She is the daughter of actor, <strong>Jamie Dornan</strong>, and his wife, <strong>Amelia Warner</strong>. Her father is known for his role as Christian Grey in the film, <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>. He has an estimated net worth of <strong>$14 Million</strong>.</p><p>Dulcie's mother, Amelia is a musician by profession. She is the oldest daughter and has two younger sisters named, <strong>Elva Dornan </strong>and<strong> Alberta Dornan</strong>. Her zodiac sign is Sagittarius.</p><h2>About Dulcie Parent's Married Life</h2><p>Dulcie Dornan is the daughter of actor, Jamie Dornan and musician, Amelia Warner. Her parents walked down the aisle on <strong>April 26, 2013</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>For Dulcie's father, it was love at first sight. They two first crossed paths in <strong>2010</strong> and it was Jamie who asked Dulcie's mother to spend the rest of her life with him.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/10/307527903_757639761974550_2808890498064876154_n%20(1)-1678444513212.jpg><p>And, the proposal was special because Jamie had asked for Amelia's hands in the same spot where they first met. It was on the steps of the house of his friend where he had first seen her and he felt it was the perfect place to propose.&nbsp;</p><p>Seems like it worked fine as Jamie and Amelia are enjoying their married life.</p><h2>Net Worth Of Jamie Dornan And Amelia Warner</h2><p>Dulcie Dornan is only nine years old at the time of this writing meaning she is too young to be working and making money. So, we will instead be focusing on her parent's wealth. Her father, Jamie Dornan has an estimated net worth of <strong>$14 Million</strong> and her mother, Amelia Warner has an estimated net worth of <strong>$3 Million</strong>.</p><p>Amelia's main source of income is music as she is a music composer by profession. She mostly makes music for movies and has found a lot of success doing that. She has made songs for films like <i>Wild Mountain Thyme </i>and<i> Mr. Malcolm's List </i>which have helped her to earn a lot of money.</p><p>Jamie's main source of income is acting. His most commercially successful work in his career so far has been <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i>. He made a total of <strong>$250,000</strong> from the film as per his <i>IMDb</i> page. The film earned <strong>$166.1 Million</strong> at the box office as per <i>Rotten Tomatoes.</i></p><h2>The Oldest Of The Three Sisters</h2><p>Dulcie Dornan isn't the only child of <i>The Fall </i>actor, Jamie as he and Amelia have two other kids as well. They have a total of three daughters with Dulcie being the oldest one. Her younger sisters are <strong>Elva Dornan </strong>and<strong> </strong><a href=#><strong>Alberta Dornan</strong></a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/10/275471976_654562769144773_9128893983899879659_n%20(1)-1678444731339.jpg><p>Elva was the child Dulcie's parents had after her as she was born on <strong>February 16, 2016</strong>. The youngest Alberta was born on <strong>March 31, 2019</strong>. All three daughters share an amazing bond. They love to do all the fun activities together as evidenced by the Insta page of Dulcie's parents.</p><h2>Dulcie Lost Her GrandFather To Covid And GrandMother To Cancer</h2><p>Dulcie has lost her grandparents from her father's side. Her grandfather, <strong>Jim Dornan</strong> died of Covid-19, and her grandmother, <strong>Lorna Dornan</strong> died of pancreatic cancer. Lorna died in <strong>1998</strong> when Dulcie's father, Jamie was only 16. And Jim succumbed to the deadly virus on <strong>March 15, 2021</strong>, in &nbsp;Dubai.&nbsp;</p><p>Even worse was that Jamie was stuck in a Hotel in Australia going through quarantine when he found out about what happened to his father as reported in <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>The Guardian</i></a>. The article also mentioned that he was in the hospital for his regular knee operation before he contracted the virus which ultimately took his life.</p><p>Jim worked in the field of medicine himself, as he was an obstetrician and gynecologist by profession. It has been mentioned on the<i> Fifty Shades of Grey</i> actor, Jamie's <i>IMDb</i> page that Dulcie's grandfather had delivered more than 6000 babies in his career.&nbsp;</p><h2>Dulcie Is Into Music</h2><p>Jamie Dornan's daughter Dulcie Dornan is following in the footsteps of her mother as she has already developed a love for music. She may be only nine years old but you can tell she is a talented little girl as she knows how to play the guitar.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/10/273566115_147883410997938_4000096391920149750_n%20(1)-1678445061263.jpg><p>You can find a couple of pictures of Dulicie on her mother, Amelia's Insta page where she is with her guitar. It would be safe to assume it was the mother that got her into music as she is the only musician in the family.</p><h2>Dulcie's Other Grandparents Are Film Stars</h2><p>Dulcie grandparents from her mother, Amelia's side are celebrities. Her grandfather, <strong>Alun Lewis</strong>, and grandmother, <a href=#><strong>Annette Ekblom</strong></a> are both actors. English actors have been active in the industry since the late 70s.</p><p>Alun is an actor born in 1949, who has worked on TV shows for the majority of his long career. He is known for his work in <i>Birds of a Feather, Emmerdale Farm, Noah's Castle, </i>and<i> The Strange Affair of Adelaide Harris.</i> He hails from Wandsworth, London.</p><p>Annette's filmography is also mostly made up of TV series works. She was born in 1959 in New Brighton, Merseyside. Some of her recognizable works include <i>A Touch of Frost, Casualty, Fever Pitch, </i>and<i> The Broker's Man.&nbsp;</i></p><h2>Has A Furry Friend</h2><p>Other than her two sisters, Elva and Alberta, Dulcie also has a furry little friend to play with. Her family has a pet dog named, <strong>Lenny</strong>. Lenny is an obedient dog and an important part of the Dornan family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/3/10/313192555_488840319878344_2930200847795549363_n%20(1)-1678445229863.jpg><p>Both of Dulcie's parents, Jamie and Amelia love to post about Lenny on their Instagram. Lenny is an adventurous dog and loves to do outdoor activities.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who Are Dulcie's Parents?</h2><p>Dulcie parents, Jamie Dornan and Amelia Warner are both involved in the film industry. Her father, Jamie is an actor, and her mother, Amelia is a musician. And both of them have found success in their respective career.</p><p>Amelia is a music composer and mostly composes music for films. She has shown her talent in movies like <i>Wild Mountain Thyme, Mary Shelley, </i>and<i> Mr. Malcolm's List.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Jamie is an actor popularly known for his role as Christian Grey in <i>Fifty Shades of Grey.</i> While most people only associate him with that role, he has shown that he possesses a range of acting skills as he has shown in movies and TV shows like <i>The Fall </i>and<i> A Private War.&nbsp;</i></p><h2>Jamie Is A Caring And Fun Father</h2><p><i>Anthropoid</i> actor, Jamie shares an amazing bond with his three daughters. He is protective of his kids and he doesn't want the media to interfere with Dulcie and his sister's life. Hence, he and his wife only upload pics of their kids where their faces are hidden.</p><figure class=media></figure><p>Besides that, Jamie is also a fun father and he loves to spend time with his daughters doing the things they like. He also learns from his kid as they taught him to be patient during the Covid lockdown. <a href=# rel=nofollow><i>People</i></a> have reported him saying that the kids were the reason that brought some happiness during that time in the family.</p><p>Dulcie's father has previously uploaded pictures of him on his Insta where he was dressed up by his daughters.
