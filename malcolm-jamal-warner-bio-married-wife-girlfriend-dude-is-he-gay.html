award-winning American actress Regina King, which lasted two and a half years before they split in 2013.</p><p>News filtered out that Malcolm Jamal Warner is a father.&nbsp;Although the news came as a surprise, it apparently wasn’t for the Thomas family (his late girlfriend Michelle’s family) as it was Phynjuar Thomas, Michelle Thomas’ mother, who delivered a congratulatory message to Warner while distributing the sex of said baby as a girl.</p><p>We still don’t know who the mother of his child is is that he has been able to keep this part of his life really personal but people believe she is
