She met Australian stuntman Ben-Smith Peterson in 2015 while working on the set of “Mad Max: Fury Road,” and they are now married. Riley has always been honest about how much she adores her late mother and grandparents.</p><p>The group was frequently referred to as “the Presley women.” She discussed how her grandmother and mother, Lisa, allowed her to develop into her own person rather than having her grandfather’s presence overshadow her during an interview with Oprah Winfrey. But once more, Elvis was always a big part of her life even if she never met him.</p><h3>Benjamin Keough</h3>View this post on Instagram<p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none href=# rel=noopener>A post shared by Riley Keough (@rileykeough)</a></p><p>Riley’s younger brother Benjamin Keogh was the child of Lisa and Danny Keough.

On July 12, 2020, Benjamin committed suicide in Calabasas, California, in the United States.</p><p>Brandon Howard, a friend of Benjamin’s, discussed his battle with mental illness and the “pressure” to live up to the Presley name. He claimed that “he occasionally struggled with depression, which is a severe issue given [the COVID-19 pandemic], everything that is going on, and the fact that everyone is confined to their homes.</p><p>When you’re under a lot of pressure from your family and from upholding a reputation and an image, it’s difficult. The pressure is great. It almost feels like you’re under pressure to be an actress or musician. Having his own friends and seeing the world was beneficial for Benjamin, Brandon said at the time of Benjamin’s passing.</p><p>At Graceland, Elvis Presley’s historic estate in Memphis, Tennessee, Benjamin was laid to rest. Graceland posted on its official Facebook page that Benjamin Storm Presley Keough was laid to rest in the Meditation Garden there alongside his family, including his grandfather, Elvis Presley, great-grandmother, Gladys Presley, great-grandfather, Vernon Presley, and great-great-grandmother, Minnie Mae Presley.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u498f898c8dec4c5b4ab79e4fcc76489b><span class=ctaText>ALSO READ</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Lisa Presley’s Four Famous Husbands & How Was Their Relationship</span></a><p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Benjamin-Keough-Elvis-Presley-1.jpg alt="lisa marie presley net worth,priscilla presley,priscilla presley children,how many children does lisa marie presley have,elvis presley,what does lisa marie presley look like now,where is lisa marie presley now,elvis presley wife,elvis presley kids,lisa marie presley children&amp;#039;s names,lisa marie presley children&amp;#039;s father,lisa marie presley children&amp;#039;s age,lisa marie presley facts,lisa marie presley quotes,what is lisa marie presley&amp;#039;s net worth in 2020,how much is lisa marie presley&amp;#039;s net worth,did lisa presley have twins" width=600 height=399 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Riley, Benjamin’s sister, has publicly lamented the death of her younger brother.
