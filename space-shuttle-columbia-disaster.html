This shuttle was called the Columbia, named after the first American ship to travel the North American Pacific coast, and it debuted in April 1981.</p><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <span class=caption-body>January 16, 2003 - The crew of the Space Shuttle Columbia walk toward what would be their final space launch. </span><span class=credit>NASA/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>A group of people at Cape Canaveral, Florida watch the Columbia's final launch. </span><span class=credit>NASA/Getty Images</span> <span class=caption-body>Still image taken from the 13-minute video filmed by the crew as they prepared for reentry.

They kept a video log of their experiments and time aboard the shuttle, offering a firsthand glance into life in space.</p><p>But despite its successful launch, all was not well with the shuttle. Roughly a minute-and-a-half into their launch, a piece of foam fell from a "bipod ramp" attached to the shuttle's external tank fell and struck Columbia's left wing. It caused no issues during launch but raised concerns among NASA staff that the wing may have sustained significant damage.</p><p>Even as members of NASA staff called for photos of the wing in orbit, and the Department of Defense offered to examine it with orbital spy cameras, higher-ups within the space program opted not to press the issue — and argued that little could be done to fix it, even if the shuttle had been damaged.</p><p>Following the crash, the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) would determine that the Columbia crew could have repaired the damage to the wing, if they had been aware of it, or that they could have remained in orbit for an additional two weeks and awaited rescue from the Atlantis shuttle, which was planned to launch on February 15.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-415813 alt="Columbia Astronauts Prepare To Land" width=900 height=671 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/columbia-astronauts-prepare-to-land.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-415813 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>NASA-TV/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Video footage shows members of the Columbia crew as they prepared to re-enter Earth's atmosphere.</span></p><p>Instead, the Columbia began its return to the Kennedy Space Center as planned, and ended in catastrophe.</p><h2>How Wing Damage Caused It To Break Apart Upon Re-Entry</h2><p>On February 1, 2003, just before 9 a.m., the Space Shuttle Columbia was 231,000 feet above California, traveling at 23 times the speed of sound when the first signs of trouble appeared.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>HISTORY</a>, the foam insulation had damaged the heat-resistant tiles that coated Columbia's left wing — and created an opening that allowed the intense wind and heat of its reentry to enter the wing and rip it apart from the inside.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-415816 alt="Man Watching Columbia Crash News" width=900 height=601 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/man-watching-columbia-crash-news.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-415816 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Abid Katib/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>A Palestinian man watching news of the Columbia disaster live in the Gaza Strip.</span></p><p>At 8:59 a.m., the Capcom, or spacecraft communicator, contacted Columbia to inquire about the shuttle's tire pressure readings, which had also gone dark. Commander Rick Husband responded, "Roger—" but was cut off mid-sentence. The crew lost contact with Mission Control.</p><p>A minute later, as Columbia soared over Texas, debris began crashing to the Earth. Texans reported hearing a loud explosion and seeing streaks of smoke in the sky as Columbia disintegrated before their eyes. At 9:12 a.m., Mission Control received a phone call informing them that a network news program showed video of Columbia breaking apart.</p><p>NASA called the event a shuttle "contingency" and sent out multiple search and rescue teams to examine the debris sites, which ranged from Texas to Arkansas and Louisiana.</p><p>During the search, two pilots aboard a search helicopter died in a crash, and later that day, NASA declared the Columbia's crew had been lost. Pieces of the shuttle and the crew's remains were recovered over the course of the following month from more than 2,000 square miles spread across three states.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-415815 alt="Columbia Shuttle Smoke" width=900 height=563 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/columbia-shuttle-smoke.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-415815 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>STAN HONDA/AFP/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Smoke from fires caused by the debris of the Space Shuttle Columbia as seen from above.</span></p><p>"This is indeed a tragic day for the NASA family, for the families of the astronauts who flew on STS-107, and likewise is tragic for the nation," said Sean O'Keefe, administrator of NASA at the time of the crash.</p><p>The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster marked a turning point for NASA, and led to far-reaching consequences for the space program.</p><h2>The Aftermath Of The Columbia Disaster</h2><p>Following the disintegration of the Columbia shuttle, NASA and the Federal Emergency Management Agency began work to recover the debris that had broken away. In total, they collected 84,000 pieces — and found crew remains scattered among them, later identified using DNA.</p><p>Per FBI reports, the total number of people who took part in the search and recovery mission was more than 25,000. They scoured roughly 2.3 million acres of land looking for Columbia debris, and managed to collect roughly 40 percent of the shuttle's weight.</p><p>Special Agent Gary Reinecke was among a group of agents tasked with handling hazardous material at a staging area in Lufkin, Texas. Upon arriving, Lufkin recalled, "I had no idea what to expect when I got down there. It was just swarming with astronauts."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-415812 alt="Bodies Of Columbia Astronauts" width=900 height=587 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bodies-of-columbia-astronauts.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-415812 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>A U.S. Air Force Honor Guard carries the remains of crew members from the Columbia in a tribute ceremony.</span></p><p>As the search teams scoured the country for debris and remains, they sent reports back to the FBI with possible locations of crew remains.</p><p>"After we determined we had found a crew member, we documented the scene like we would a crime scene—we mapped it and took pictures. But in this case, we didn't keep any evidence. We turned everything over to NASA," Reinecke said.</p><p>In August 2003, the CAIB report detailed the ways in which the Columbia disaster could have been avoided and revealed that a number of managerial decisions and the overall culture at NASA contributed heavily to the incident.</p><p>"Cultural traits and organizational practices detrimental to safety were allowed to develop," the report reads. The board found that NASA relied too heavily on "past success as a substitute for sound engineering practices" and cited "organizational barriers that prevented effective communication of critical safety information" alongside other major issues.</p><p>Following the Columbia disaster, the space shuttle program was grounded until 2005 while NASA implemented new safety measures and reworked the fundamental components of the space shuttles. On July 16, 2005, Discovery launched and entered orbit.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-415814 alt="Columbia Crew In Space" width=900 height=672 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/columbia-crew-in-space.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-415814 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>NASA/Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>Left to Rright, Payload Specialist Ilan Ramon, Mission Specialist Kalpana Chawla, Commander Rick Husband, and Mission Specialist Laurel Clark aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia.</span></p><p>In 2008, NASA additionally released a crew survival report that offered insight into the crew's final moments, revealing that they likely survived the initial breakup but quickly lost consciousness when the cabin lost pressure. They died when Columbia disintegrated.</p><p>The crew's memory has not been forgotten, however. Their deaths receive a public tribute each year during NASA's Day of Remembrance, and personal artifacts from both the Columbia's crew and the Challenger's crew are on display at the Kennedy Space Center.</p><p>Seven asteroids orbiting the sun between Mars and Jupiter have also been given the names of the seven Columbia crew members.</p><p>After learning about this unfortunate disaster, remember <a href=#>the glory days of space exploration through these 44 vintage photos</a>.
