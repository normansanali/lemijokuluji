Is it a coincidence that it’s 27 years, a number that should instantly ring a bell for It fans? The evil force that takes the form of Pennywise in that hit book and film returns every — you guessed it — 27 years. What if the Kid is a manifestation of that force? Bill Skarsgård playing the Kid seemed like little more than a polite nod to the hit film, but what if he’s essentially playing the same evil life force?
