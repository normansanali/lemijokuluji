He fit in well with the team, and his rebounding skills were phenomenal, getting 1,530 rebounds in 1992. However, in 1992, Pistons’ coach Chuck Daly, who Rodman often thought of as a surrogate father, left the team. Rodman demanded a trade and went to the San Antonio Spurs. The following year, Dennis Rodman had problems with the Spurs front office and found himself suspended several times.</p><p>After two years, the Spurs traded Rodman to the Chicago Bulls for the 1995 season.

Dennis’s sisters, Debra Rodman and Kim Rodman, excelled at basketball, being named All-Americans in college.</p><p>Dennis Rodman has been married three times. His first wife was Annie Bakes.
