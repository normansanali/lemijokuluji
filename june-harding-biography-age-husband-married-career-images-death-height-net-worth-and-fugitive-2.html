Beauty columnist Arlene Dahl interviewed Ms. Harding, who said she had no beauty secrets to impart, as she wore little makeup and did her own hair. The only thing Ms. Harding offered of interest was that she often stood on her head, which Dahl duly noted.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><p>The Hollywood Reporter, in reviewing her performance, called her “an exceptionally vivid and convincing young actress” who handled her scenes with “competence and poignancy.”</p><p>That April, her hometown honored her with a “June Harding Day.” Emporia Mayor George Lee gave her the key to the city.</p><p>She rode in an open convertible during a parade; went to her parents’ home atop a firetruck with a dozen happy, small boys; and later wore a pink chiffon dress to a dinner in her honor and to Pitts Theater, which screened her film in one of its East Coast premieres.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-918 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 mobile-leaderboard-1 mobile-leaderboard-1918 adtester-container adtester-container-918" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-mobile-leaderboard-1><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-mobile-leaderboard-1-0 style=position:relative;z-index:0;padding:0;position:sticky!important;top:0!important;min-height:100px;min-width:320px class="ezoic-ad ezads-sticky-intradiv ezoic-adl"></span></span><span style=height:14px;margin:auto;position:relative class=reportline><span style=text-align:center;font-size:12px!important;font-family:arial!important;float:right;line-height:normal class=ezoicwhat></span></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span></p><p>She later chose not to reprise her “Angels” role as Mills’ comedic sidekick Rachel Devery in the film’s sequel, “Where Angels Go, Trouble Follows.”</p><p>The Emporia native got her first chance at being in a bona fide play during her senior year at Greensville County High School when the girl who was supposed to play the lead in “Cupid in Pigtails” fell ill.</p><p>“I got out of my classes for four days so I could learn lines,” Ms. Harding said in a Richmond Times-Dispatch interview. “A friend cued me.”</p><p>After graduating from high school in 1955, she earned a bachelor’s degree in fine arts with a drama major from Richmond Professional Institute, now Virginia Commonwealth University. Her portrayal as the lead in the drama “Antigone” earned her the school’s Hodges Award as the outstanding young actress that year.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-919 data-method=placement-service></span><span class="ezoic-ad ezoic-at-0 narrow-sky-1 narrow-sky-1919 adtester-container adtester-container-919" data-ez-name=informationcradle_com-narrow-sky-1><span id=div-gpt-ad-informationcradle_com-narrow-sky-1-0 style=position:relative;z-index:0;padding:0;position:sticky!important;top:0!important;min-height:100px;min-width:320px class="ezoic-ad ezads-sticky-intradiv ezoic-adl"></span></span><span style=height:14px;margin:auto;position:relative class=reportline><span style=text-align:center;font-size:12px!important;font-family:arial!important;float:right;line-height:normal class=ezoicwhat></span></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_8"></span></p><p>Then, it was off to New York. She studied acting under Lonny Chapman at The Theater Studio of New York. She took ballet and practiced yoga.</p><p>She did summer stock in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and New York. In one musical, she recalled playing six different roles, complete with costume changes, and dashing offstage occasionally to work the stage lights.</p><p>In New York, she quickly landed a recurring role on the CBS soap opera “As the World Turns.” Ms. Harding appeared in the off-Broadway productions of “The Innocents Abroad,” “The Boy Friend” and “Cry of the Raindrop,” which won her a Daniel Blum Theater World Award.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_9"></span></p><p>Her performance in “Raindrop” led to an opportunity to read for a part in “Under the Yum-Yum Tree,” which later opened on Broadway.
