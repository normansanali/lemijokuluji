When you’re playing, what you do on the field is the most important thing.“&nbsp;<strong>– Peyton Manning</strong></p><p>16. “My high-school coach Tony Reginelli was kind of famous for ‘Reggie-isms,’ kind of like ‘Yogi-isms.’ He always said if you want to be a good quarterback, when sprinting left you want to be amphibious and throw left-handed. I told him, ‘You mean ambidextrous, coach?'” <strong>– Peyton Manning</strong></p><p>17. “Being there every week for my teammates is really important to me. It’s all about accountability.

I wanted to be a good high school player, and I worked hard at that. That made me good enough to play in college and then I wanted to be a good college quarterback. During college I played well enough to make it into the NFL. I never took it for granted and really wanted to play hard at each level and I have always had a lot of fun doing what I wanted to do.” <strong>– Peyton Manning</strong></p><p>21. “I’m proud to be Archie’s son. Being a quarterback, I had my mentor and hero living in the same house.”&nbsp;<strong>– Peyton Manning</strong></p><p>22. “I’ve been a Colt for almost all of my adult life, but I guess in life, and in sports, we all know nothing lasts forever.

We know what it takes.”&nbsp;<strong>– Peyton Manning</strong></p><p>29. “When you take a year off from football, you come back for all the enjoyable moments. When you’re not playing, you miss out on all the highs, but you also miss these disappointments. But I would rather be in the arena to be excited or be disappointed than not have a chance at all.

I think I’ve managed to play quarterback just fine without a mustache.”&nbsp;<strong>– Peyton Manning</strong></p><p>33. “I think I could describe the perfect quarterback. Take a little piece of everybody. Take John Elway’s arm, Dan Marino’s release, maybe Troy Aikman’s drop-back, Brett Favre’s scrambling ability, Joe Montana’s two-minute poise and, naturally, my speed.”&nbsp;<strong>– Peyton Manning</strong></p><p>34. “I would like to think I will be a guy who knows when it’s time to stop.

I do not have a goal in mind of a year or a statistic.”&nbsp;<strong>– Peyton Manning</strong></p><p>35. “I’m the best manning.”&nbsp;<strong>– Peyton Manning</strong></p><p>36. “I’ve been being asked about my legacy since I was about 25 years old. I’m not sure you can have a legacy when you’re 25 years old. Even 37. I’d like to have to be, like, 70 to have a legacy. I’m not even 100 percent sure what the word even means.”&nbsp;<strong>– Peyton Manning</strong></p><p>37. “If you work hard and you play well, all those critics quiet themselves pretty quickly.”&nbsp;<strong>– Peyton Manning</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=38th-of-43-peyton-manning-quotes></span><strong>38th of 43 Peyton Manning Quotes</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>“It takes 20 years to build a reputation and 5 minutes to ruin it.”&nbsp;– Peyton Manning</strong></p><p>39. “My dad told us up front, ‘Guys, if you want to play sports, go ahead, but it’s your decision.’”&nbsp;<strong>– Peyton Manning</strong></p><p>40. “My job is to play well offensively and help my team score points.
