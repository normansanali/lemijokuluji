The movie based on the famous stage musical is still a while away, with a November release currently on the cards. A retelling of The Wizard of Oz from the perspective of the so-called Wicked Witch of the West, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wicked has been seen by millions</a>, and the songs from it continue to defy gravity in the listening charts, so it’s no surprise that the film version has some pretty big names attached.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=179 data-current-count=179 data-injectable=false>If you’re a fan of the soundtrack and want to know who’ll be bringing it to life on the cinema screen, then check out below to discover who’s starring in Wicked!</p><h2 id=h-cynthia-erivo-as-elphaba-thropp-the-wicked-witch-of-the-west data-injectable=false>Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba Thropp (The Wicked Witch of the West)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/wicked-cynthia-erivo.jpg><p data-characters=408 data-current-count=408 data-injectable=true>A West End and Broadway legend, Erivo is no stranger to big musicals, although has never acted in Wicked. We doubt this will be a problem as the native Londoner has shown on stage and screen just what she is capable of, so we’re certain she’ll bring everything and more to the lead role. After all, she’s won Tonys and been nominated at the Oscars and Golden Globes, which is no mean feat.</p><p data-characters=179 data-current-count=179 data-injectable=false>Elphaba is the witch at the heart of Wicked. A strong-minded and well-meaning young woman, she’s a complex hero who manages to be relatable while also having immense power.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ariana Grande as Galinda Upland/Glinda the Good Witch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Wicked.jpg><p data-characters=556 data-current-count=556 data-injectable=true>The pop star made her name on Broadway as a teen and is no stranger to mixing music and movies, which is why we’re sure she’ll be an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent choice for the vital role of Glinda the Good Witch</a>. The Grammy winner has a phenomenal voice and the acting chops to pull off the beloved character, who in the story is shown to not be quite as good as her name implies. Given the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">controversy around Grande and her burgeoning romance with her co-star Ethan Slater</a>, it seems that Grande may have more in common with her character than at first thought.</p><p data-characters=191 data-current-count=191 data-injectable=false>As the film is focused on the first act of the musical, we will mostly see her as Upland rather than the famous Oz character she becomes, but we’re excited to have her take on the part.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Michelle Yeoh as Madame Morrible</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/michelle-yeoh-oscars-resized.jpg><p data-characters=498 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>The Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon star earned herself an Oscar for her stellar performance in Everything Everywhere All at Once, and previously has been known for her excellent martial arts movies and action chops. In Wicked she faces a new challenge, though: learning how to use her voice professionally. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">During a red carpet interview</a> she admitted that she only sang “in the shower,” and that seeing how much her character sings in the stage production made her a little bit nervous.</p><p data-characters=155 data-current-count=155 data-injectable=false>We’re sure she’ll do a great job as Morrible, the two-faced headmistress of Shiz University, where Galinda and Elphaba meet for the first time.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jonathan Bailey as Fiyero Tigelaar</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Jonathan-Bailey.jpg><p data-characters=510 data-current-count=510 data-injectable=true>Another star who has smashed it on the boards and on-screen, Bailey takes on the role of heartthrob Fiyero. This isn’t exactly uncomfortable territory for the handsome Brit, who has been the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">object of desire in Bridgerton</a> and other performances. Bailey began his acting life early with parts in plays produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company and had appeared as Gavroche in Les Miserables before he was ten. Since then he’s put in several critically acclaimed performances across multiple mediums.</p><p data-characters=136 data-current-count=136 data-injectable=false>Fiyero is the kind-hearted prince who attends Shiz University, and the third point of a love triangle between himself and the two leads.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Ethan Slater as Boq</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Ethan-Slater.jpg><p data-characters=273 data-current-count=273 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Slater </a>has had tonnes of experience on Broadway, but his most famous role was undoubtedly the title part in the surprisingly moving Spongebob Squarepants: The Broadway Musical. That earned him a Tony nomination, and undoubtedly helped him land his current gig in Spamalot.</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=674 data-injectable=true>His character Boq is a munchkin who is in love with Glinda, but can’t seem to get her attention while she pines for Fiyero. However, he holds out hope and continues to do good, all so that he can hopefully shoot his shot with his love. Slater and co-star Grande are allegedly together now, despite both being in committed relationships before filming Wicked, so, expect some on-screen chemistry.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jeff Goldblum as the Wonderful Wizard of Oz</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Jeff-Goldblum.jpg><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=648 data-injectable=true>Goldblum is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">probably the most established Hollywood name in the cast</a>. He hasn’t had much musical experience, but the Jurassic Park legend is part of a successful jazz band, so you know he’s got it in him. He’s also shown his skills on the stage in multiple theater productions on Broadway, including as Malvolio in Twelfth Night.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=292 data-injectable=false>As he is in the famous Judy Garland film, the Wizard is a bit of a coward and charlatan, although what we will see of him in this part of the film is likely to paint Goldblum’s character in a much more friendly light. Regardless, we’re sure he’ll be his usual magnetic self.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Marissa Bode as Nessarose Thropp</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Marissa-Bode.png><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Newcomer Marissa Bode is set to dive right into the deep end of the industry with the huge part of Nessarose, Elphaba’s sister, who uses a wheelchair. The disabled actress might be a little green, but given the quality of the casting around her we’re certain she must have blown away her audition to get a shot, so we’re excited to see how she takes on this vital role.</p><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=573 data-injectable=true>Golden child Nessarose ends up becoming the ruler of Munchkinland but is known for her chaotic and occasionally cruel rule, which is why she gets nicknamed the Wicked Witch of the East.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Other cast members of Wicked Part 1</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Keala-Settle.jpg><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>Other names to be confirmed include Broadway star Keala Settle, who is taking on a part made for the film named Miss Coddle. Brit Bronwyn James will be ShenShen, one of Galinda’s college friends, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bowen Yang</a> will play the role of Pfannee, another friend of Galinda’s.</p><p data-characters=283 data-current-count=283 data-injectable=false>Grecia de la Paz will be Gilligan, Aaron Teoh will be Fieyero’s trusted friend Averic, Colin Michael Carmichael will play a teacher at Shiz University named Professor Nikidik, and Adam James will take on another newly created role for the film, that of Galinda’s father.</p><p data-characters=93 data-current-count=376 data-injectable=false>Dorothy Gale will also be featured, although we have no confirmation who will be playing her.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJorqGno2LAta3Rq6Cnn12eu27DyJyinpxdpa6zwIxqZJyZo6l6rrHMm5yrq12ks27Ax55kqKZdqLCzscSnZKato56woriMnq%2BppJGeu6qxw2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhos-starring-in-wicked-part-1-cast-members-of-the-on-screen-musical-explainied.html&text=Whos%20starring%20in%20Wicked%20Part%201%3f%20Cast%20members%20of%20the%20on-screen%20musical%2c%20explainied&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhos-starring-in-wicked-part-1-cast-members-of-the-on-screen-musical-explainied.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhos-starring-in-wicked-part-1-cast-members-of-the-on-screen-musical-explainied.html&title=Whos%20starring%20in%20Wicked%20Part%201%3f%20Cast%20members%20of%20the%20on-screen%20musical%2c%20explainied" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhos-starring-in-wicked-part-1-cast-members-of-the-on-screen-musical-explainied.html&title=Whos%20starring%20in%20Wicked%20Part%201%3f%20Cast%20members%20of%20the%20on-screen%20musical%2c%20explainied" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhos-starring-in-wicked-part-1-cast-members-of-the-on-screen-musical-explainied.html&title=Whos%20starring%20in%20Wicked%20Part%201%3f%20Cast%20members%20of%20the%20on-screen%20musical%2c%20explainied" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhos-starring-in-wicked-part-1-cast-members-of-the-on-screen-musical-explainied.html&description=Whos%20starring%20in%20Wicked%20Part%201%3f%20Cast%20members%20of%20the%20on-screen%20musical%2c%20explainied" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./618524-ari-fletcher-reacts-to-g-herbos-cheating-confession-on-caresha-please.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ari Fletcher Reacts To G Herbo's Cheating Confession On &amp;quot;Caresha Please&amp;quot;">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-dj-moore-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is DJ Moore Dating Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
