Thank you so much for taking the time to answer our members’ questions, today.</strong></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span></p><p><strong>Question #1 – If you could tell a writer one thing to help them get published, what would it be?</strong></p><p>Andrea Hall: Don’t give up! Keep writing and trying. One never knows which project will be the one that will get published.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span></p><p><strong>VL: Ah! Persistence is so important.</strong></p><p><strong>VL: Question #2 – Have you ever found a manuscript at a conference that you went on to publish?</strong></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span></p><p>AH: Not yet. But I’ve heard stories from other editors.</p><p>I did have a published author pitch me the novel of another member of her writing group at a trade show, and I did go on to publish that.</p><p><strong>VL: What a nice friend! (Another reason to join a critique group!)</strong></p><p><strong>Question #3 – What makes you cringe in a query letter?</strong></p><p>AH: Not following directions.</p><p>Telling your life story when it doesn’t pertain to the book. Mentioning that family/friends/your kids love your book. Calling the submission the next “best-seller.”</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span></p><p>If only we could predict that!</p><p><strong>VL: Yes, it’s always important to follow the submission guidelines!</strong></p><p><strong>Question #4 – What words would you recommend authors replace in their writing?</strong></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_15"></span></p><p>AH: This is going to be different for each writer.</p><p>For picture books, every word needs to count. Eliminate the words that are unnecessary.</p><p>For novels, look at words or phrases that are overused and try to avoid repetition.</p><p><strong>VL: Question #5 – Do you prefer picture books written in the past or present tense?</strong></p><p>AH: I don’t have a preference.</p><p><strong>VL: Question #6 – Could you explain what goes on inside an acquisition meeting?</strong></p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_13"></span></p><p>AH: This is where the editor pitches the book to the rest of the group and works to get everyone (hopefully) excited about it. We discuss how the book fits into our list and get feedback from sales and marketing. This determines whether or not the editor gets the green light to acquire the project.</p><p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_20"></span></p><p><strong>VL: Question #7 – How do you feel about sensitivity readers? Who is expected to obtain the services of sensitivity readers, the author or the publisher?</strong></p><p>AH: Sensitivity readers serve the necessary purpose of ensuring authenticity when writing outside one’s own cultural group. I feel it falls to both the author and publisher—the author needs to do their due diligence to make the work as authentic as possible, and the publisher needs to also double-check and verify accuracy.</p><p><strong>VL: That makes sense. Double-checking is always a good idea.</strong></p><p><strong>Question #8 – In Middle-Grade historical fiction, is it a problem if the action of a story begins when the main character is very young? (Knowing kids who read Middle Grade like characters that are a little older than they are, and also wanting to stick to the facts as much as possible without turning off readers.) Any suggestions?</strong></p><p>AH: This is tricky without knowing the context of the story. If something significant happened to the MC as a young child, which impacts the overall plot or helped shaped the character, then it makes sense to include. I suggest looking at other historical fiction titles that have done this and then find the best approach for your story.</p><p><strong>Adopted from: https://valerierlawson</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmemb%2BmrYyhmKWkXZe2sK3GnmSam6Seu6h507Cgp2WYqsCjrc2dZJ2hopqwtbvRZqWeqJiaxLR5kWg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fandrea-hall-bioage-acting-twin-husband-director-nephews-2.html&text=Andrea%20Hall%20Bio%2cAge%2c%20Acting%20%2cTwin%2c%20Husband%2c%20Director%2c%20Nephews&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fandrea-hall-bioage-acting-twin-husband-director-nephews-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fandrea-hall-bioage-acting-twin-husband-director-nephews-2.html&title=Andrea%20Hall%20Bio%2cAge%2c%20Acting%20%2cTwin%2c%20Husband%2c%20Director%2c%20Nephews" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fandrea-hall-bioage-acting-twin-husband-director-nephews-2.html&title=Andrea%20Hall%20Bio%2cAge%2c%20Acting%20%2cTwin%2c%20Husband%2c%20Director%2c%20Nephews" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fandrea-hall-bioage-acting-twin-husband-director-nephews-2.html&title=Andrea%20Hall%20Bio%2cAge%2c%20Acting%20%2cTwin%2c%20Husband%2c%20Director%2c%20Nephews" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fandrea-hall-bioage-acting-twin-husband-director-nephews-2.html&description=Andrea%20Hall%20Bio%2cAge%2c%20Acting%20%2cTwin%2c%20Husband%2c%20Director%2c%20Nephews" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./young-ben-affleck-cast-of-dazed-and-confused-relationship.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ben Affleck Felt Ostracized By The Cast Of Dazed And Confused For This Hilarious Reason">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./alexandra-krosney.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alexandra Krosne- Wiki, Age, Height, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Ethnicity">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
