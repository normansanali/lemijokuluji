Months later as the show continued to be loved it brought on board a couple of new medical examiners. And that included Joel Johnstone who we are about to talk about in the rest of this writing called ‘Joel Johnstone Bio’.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Joel Johnstone On CSI: Vegas</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Joel Johnstone joined the cast of CSI: Vegas&nbsp;midway alongside <a href=#>Sara Amini</a>. While Sara of Hulu’s Future Man&nbsp;got the role of Sonya, a regimented, methodical, and passionate head medical examiner, Joel was on board as Jack.</p><p style=text-align:left>Jack, as the network describes, is Sonya’s intelligent, curious, and optimistic older brother and the assistant medical examiner.</p><p style=text-align:left>Both these actors were signed as recurring actors. So, unlike non-returning William Peterson and Jorja Fox from Season 1, there is a high chance Joel’s Jack will be on the show through multiple episodes either over the course of this or the entire series (i.e. upcoming seasons).</p><p style=text-align:left>Hyping his new job as an actor, Joel even took to Instagram to share his excitement. On it, he wrote that he is thrilled because he gets to not only play with the CSI Vegas team but also a big brother to a “super actor and human”.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Joel Johnstone Net Worth</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Joel Johnstone reportedly owned above $2 million as his net worth as of 2022.</p><p>He is best known for playing Archie on The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&nbsp;(2017), The Newsroom (2012), and The Astronaut Wives Club (2015). Now, though it may look like smooth sailing, it certainly was not for Joel.</p><p>Joel opened up during an interview that nothing was easy for him before he began to work as an actor. Out of college, it took him some eleven years before he really began working.</p><p>Before he was able to quit side jobs of working at the bars and clubs, Joel had only done three or four dozen plays; double or triple that in staged readings; and had written, directed, and produced his own short film and took it around the festival circuit.</p><p>After moving to Los Angeles, his first job was the one Garry Marshall gave him. Garry had cast him in a play he had written and produced at his theatre in Burbank. Joel says he is always grateful for the job.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is Joel Johnstone Married?</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Yes. Joel Johnstone is married. He got married to <a href=#>Ada Yan</a> of New York, New York on 25 July 2015.</p><p>Ada, according to her Facebook, did not seem to have anything to do with the industry that her husband works for. She apparently studied Finance at Baruch College after Murry Bergtraum High School. Also, as per LinkedIn, she formerly worked as an international senior director of Anastasia Beverly Hills, a personal care product manufacturer.</p><p>Joel and Ada were together for a long time before they decided to exchange wedding vows. A memory of them together at a certain red carpet event from back in September 2008 still remained on Facebook. They likely started dating (or met) in 2007 when they took their very first picture together.</p><p>Together, these people also have a son who turned 6 in June 2022. They have named him Austin Stephen Johnstone and they believe their young man is the most selfless, kind-hearted boy.</p><p>Not to miss, as of the time of this writing, there was also a new baby coming. Around mid-July in 2022, Joel threw his pregnant wife a surprise baby shower. So, you may do the maths by yourself as to when the new baby is coming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gossipnextdoor.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/joel-johnstone-bio-height-net-worth-family-married-2022-300x300.jpg><p>Both Joel and his wife (on Instagram <a href=#>@ada_yan810</a>) love Instagramming their life together with Austin. From their fine date night during the Golden Globe award ceremony to gushing about one another during birthdays, father’s day, and mother’s day, they never missed showing up on social media on special occasions.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Joel Johnstone Height</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Of charming, likeable personality and good looks, Joel Johnstone stands around 5 feet and 9 inches in height.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Joel Johnstone Family</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Joel Johnstone’s father, Stephen Johnstone is no longer alive. Having been born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, graduated from Bellarmine University in 1966, and worked at The Falk Group LLC, he passed away in 2014. He was gone five months after celebrating his 70th birthday with his family.</p><p>Before cancer took his life, Stephen had spent more than four decades as a public relations executive in Milwaukee and volunteered for many charitable causes. He was also a gate crasher who managed to run out onto a basketball court as the buzzer sounded at an NCAA championship.</p><p>So, apparently, his dad was the reason Joel turned out to be a baseball fanatic. Even today he believes that if someone was to offer him to play center field for the Brewers, he would drop everything.</p><p>As for Joel’s mother, Beverley Johnstone not much was known about her. She reached the age of 74 in January of 2022. And at the time, was based in Bronx, New York.</p><p>At last, we can also tell that Joel has two sisters: Mary Shannon Johnstone and Gina Murray (Johnstone). 49-year-old Mary was living around Raleigh, North Carolina, and Gina, 51, around Raleigh, North Carolina, as of 2022.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Is Joel Johnstone On Instagram?</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Yes. Joel Johnstone could be found on Instagram @joeljohnstone;&nbsp;there were 143 posts and 4,449 followers here (as of 3 August 2022).</p><p>The actor/filmmaker also seemed active on Twitter <a href=#>@joelsjohnstone</a>, <a href=#>Facebook</a>, and <a href=#>Cameo</a>.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4>How Old Is Joel Johnstone?</h4></li></ul><p style=text-align:left>Born on 3 September 1984, Joel Johnstone reached the age of 37 in 2021.</p><ul style=text-align:left><li><h4>Where Is Joel Johnstone From?</h4></li></ul><p>Joel Johnstone was born and bred in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
