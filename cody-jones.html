He holds American nationality.</p><p>The name and information of his parents are not available at the moment. Similarly, information regarding his other family members such as his siblings and others is also not available until now.</p><p>It seems as if he likes to keep his family life and parents away from the limelight and social world. However, it is known that he loves spending time with his family.</p><p>Moreover, he was born into a religious family and his family went to church every Sunday.</p><p>Regarding his educational background and qualifications, he attended Texas A&M University to study finance and real estate to study finance and real estate.</p><p>Likewise, as a high school student, he played basketball and was also part of the school’s basketball team which won the 2005-06 Class 5A State Championship for boys.</p><p>And, by the end of high school, he entered a phase when he “stayed away from the Lord” and his attention shifted more toward basketball and girls. However, three months later, he rediscovered religion.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-73116 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Cody-Jones-Friends.jpg alt="Cody Jones" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-73116 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Cody Jones along with his friends (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Cody_Jones_8211_Personal_Life>Cody Jones – Personal Life</span></h2><p>Cody Jones’s favorite TV shows are Sports Center, The Office, and any sport, and their favorite movies are The Patriot, Top Gun, Gladiator, Remember the Titans, and Inception.</p><p>And, his dream Dude Perfect shot is a shot off the Burj Khalifa tower in Dubai.</p><p>Likewise, he is a fan of the Dallas Cowboys, Dallas Mavericks, Texas Rangers, and Blake Griffin, and he would like to meet Blake Griffin, Chuck Norris, and Oprah Winfrey.</p><p>Moreover, if he could do anything, he would fly. His greatest moment was beating Tyler. And, as of episode 15 of “Overtime”, Jones is now the only person to have not broken a Guinness World Record on ‘Absurd Records’.</p><p>He has beat a world record on World Record Edition 1 and 2 and some other occasions as well.</p><p>However, he was not able to compete in three battles and missed out in the Snow Sports battle because he hurt himself, the Blitzball 3 Battle because he was having a baby, and the Drone Racing Battle as well.</p><p>Furthermore, Jones is not good at video games and is usually pretty loud. Jones’s favorite Dude Perfect Trick Shot was the Sling Shot and claims he “lost his mind” when the ball went into the basketball hoop.</p><p>Likewise, Jones might have done the longest putt in his life in ‘All Sports Golf Battle (3)’ and has been in The Wheel Unfortunate once (first episode) where he had to get a level 10 spray tan.</p><p>Moreover, he has won the second most battles after Tyler. In one of the episodes of The Dude Perfect Show, it is revealed that he is scared of heights.</p><p>Likewise, he has gone the longest without spinning the wheel for Wheel Unfortunate, at 15 episodes. Likewise, he is currently the only C-O person to not spin the Wheel Unfortunate wheel twice.</p><p>He was once accidentally called Jody Cones by Ned Forrester in episode 1 of Overtime. And, he is the first Dude Perfect guy to get a nickname that is not just one syllable, with the other being Tyler.</p><h2><span id=Cody_Jones_8211_Career_and_Professional_Life>Cody Jones – Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>Cody Jones was attending Texas A&M University when he met his future partners, twins Coby and Cory Cotton, Garrett Hilbert, and Tyler Toney.</p><p>And, He first met the Cotton twins, while they were playing basketball at the university’s recreation center. Then, the twins invited him to stay in a house that they shared with Hilbert and Toney.</p><p>After graduating, Jones briefly worked in real estate. Then, the five friends set up the channel under the name “Dude Perfect” on March 17, 2009, and have accumulated 11,705,318,739 views until now.</p><p>. Their first video “Backyard Edition”, featured them performing progressively more complex basketball shots in their backyard over a bet on sandwiches.</p><p>The video was posted on April 8, 2009, and garnered over 200K views within one week. Realizing that they had something special there, Jones and others started to upload content regularly.</p><p>Then, soon enough, professional endorsement offers and requests started to pour in. Likewise, the first request came from the then-Sacramento Kings player Tyreke Evans, who was then hopeful for the Rookie of the Year accolade.</p><p>Then, in the subsequent years, they have also collaborated with actors like Paul Rudd, singer Tim McGraw, Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll and quarterback Russell Wilson, Ryan Swope,</p><p>volleyball star Morgan Beck, Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Johnny Manzie, and the US Olympics team. And, their official mascot is a panda.</p><h4><span>More About Career…</span></h4><p>Moreover, Dude Perfect has released a series of self-titled mobile games for iOS and Android. In September 2015, Jones and the others secured a TV series deal with CMT titled “The Dude Perfect Show”</p><p>which is the series that began airing in early 2016. Moreover, at 6 feet 6 inches, Jones is referred to as the “tall guy” by the fans.</p><p>Some of the popular videos on this channel are&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Water Bottle Flip 2 | Dude Perfect</a>, Ping Pong Trick Shots 3 | Dude Perfect, Real Life Trick Shots 2 | Dude Perfect, Real Life Trick Shots |</p><p>Dude Perfect,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Ping Pong Trick Shots 2 | Dude Perfect.&nbsp;All of these videos have garnered more than 200 Million views now.</p><p>Furthermore, the group set up another channel under the name “DudePerfectTV” on August 30, 2011, and has accumulated altogether 37,993,836 views to date. It is a vlogging channel.</p><p>Moreover, they also have a third channel, “trickshots” which was surprisingly created even before the main channel, on June 5, 2006. And, it seems to be the least amount of activities.</p><p>However, they are not active on both of these channels. They stopped sharing videos on these channels a long time ago. Also, these channels don’t have many subscribers, to begin with.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-73115 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Cody-Jones-Youtube.jpg alt="Cody Jones" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-73115 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Cody Jones’s group’s tour (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Cody_Jones_8211_Relationship_Status>Cody Jones – Relationship Status</span></h2><p>After completing his education, Cody Jones married his long-time girlfriend, <strong>Allison.</strong> They have two children and their names are Landry and Lucy.</p><p>He has shared a lot of pictures along with his wife and children on his social accounts.
