On the afternoon of January 6, SM Entertainment announced that NCT Haechan will temporarily halt the schedule so that he could take a break and receive medical attention.<img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/dotcomstories.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/NCT-2-1.jpg alt="haechan,nct,nct members,nct 127 members,nct haechan injury,haechan childhood photos,nct haechan memes" width=1280 height=1280 sizes="(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The NCT won’t be able to work with Haechan on any activities the following week because of his absence. NCT’s hectic schedule during their current promotional period has caused concern among fans. The entire declaration is as follows:</p><p>“Hello.</p><p>The health of member Haechan is being reported, as is his absence from the schedule.</p><p>Haechan had been having heart palpitations and chest pain, so he went to the hospital with his boss for a checkup and obtained the proper care. Haechan will miss appointments in order to rest and recover because it is crucial for him to get enough sleep.</p><p>As a result, Haechan won’t be present for the next week’s schedules. We will announce when he will resume his activities at a later time. We apologise for worrying Haechan’s supporters and kindly ask for your understanding regarding his well-being.</p><p>We will put a lot of effort into helping Haechan heal and come back in good health.</p><p>I’m grateful.</p><p>Recently, Haechan began to feel symptoms of an erratic heartbeat and shortness of breath. His manager took him to the emergency hospital, where he had a consultation and medical examination.</p><p>He is so instructed to take some time off work and rest so that he can heal. Next week’s group meetings are scheduled, but Haechan in particular won’t be there because of his vacation.</p><h3>NCT 127’s Latin American and US Tours Will Not Feature Haechan</h3><p>On the same day that DREAM MAKER USA announced her absence, Haechan was also informed that he would not take the stage at the next Latin American and US tour legs of NCT 127. NCT DREAM recently received promotion from Haechan as a result of the group’s recent release of the new remake of Candy.</p><p>NCT 127’s repackaged album Ay-Yo, which will be released later this month, will be the group’s return. The NCT has encountered this situation before, with a member missing time due to illness. Mark Lee mentioned his tiredness during the group’s comeback, despite the fact that Jaehyun had already experienced the same issue.</p><h3>Who Is NCT’s Haechan?</h3><p>Its more popular name is HAECHAN. South Korean singer Lee Dong-hyuck is better known by his stage name Lee Dong-hyuck. He is a member of the boy band NCT, of which his units are NCT 127, NCT DREAM, and NCT U. He is a member of the boy band NCT and its subunits NCT 127, NCT DREAM, and NCT U who was born in South Korea.</p><p>He ended up going to an SM audition since his mother had persuaded him to. Haechan joined SM as a result of the Weekly Auditions. He was first debuted on July 17, 2014, as a member of SM Entertainment’s pre-debut training unit SMROOKIES. In 2016, he made his official debut as a member of NCT 127.</p><p>To ensure that NCT member Haechan’s rehabilitation goes as smoothly as possible, relaxation is now advised. Our hope is that he will get better as soon as possible.
