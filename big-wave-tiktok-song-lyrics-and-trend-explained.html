The Big Wave TikTok original is titled Dice by NMIXX.</p><p>Nowadays, TikTok is everywhere and has seemingly affected every facet of life, and music is no exception. Songs often go viral in TikTok, regardless of genre, age, or even language.</p><p>Usually, these songs become viral through the help of a certain trend or dance, and this newest Big Wave trend is no exception.</p><p>Over 80K people made participated in the trend, and that too is only from the official song, with thousands more making their own song via edits, bringing the full usage to even a million.</p><p>The sound has even surpassed being strictly a dance, with people using it in a variety of new and interesting ways from fan cams, to makeup edits, and more.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title=" The Big Wave TikTok Song Explained">The Big Wave TikTok Song Explained</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="Big Wave TikTok Lyrics Meaning">Big Wave TikTok Lyrics Meaning</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title=" Big Wave Big Wave By NMIXX Becomes A TikTok Trend">Big Wave Big Wave By NMIXX Becomes A TikTok Trend</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title=" Who Are NMIXX?&nbsp;">Who Are NMIXX?&nbsp;</a></li></ul><h2 id=the-big-wave-tiktok-song-explained><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-big-wave-tiktok-song-explained></span> The Big Wave TikTok Song Explained<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Big Wave TikTok song is actually a K-Pop song called Dice. Dice was released by the South Korean girl group NMIXX under the album Entwurf in 2022.</p><p>Entwurf single album, released on September 19, 2022, consisted of Dice and another song called Cool (Your Rainbow) and their subsequent instrumentals.</p><p>Dice is a surprisingly experimental K Pop song with hints of the usual formula including Pop Rap and Contemporary R&B, but mixes it up with a variety of left-field influences like Hyphy, Electro Swing, and even Soul.</p><p>The song can be seen as a mash-up of genres with three different sections.&nbsp;</p><p>The intro of the song features a jazz sample that slowly turns into an electro-swing fare, with member Jiwoo laughing, then one of the members Kyujin rapping while Bae, Jiwoo, and Jinni provide the ad-libs.</p><p>The rap is fairly standard with some English words like drama and scene added to the mix. Kyujin, Bae, and Sullywoon then start singing the pre-chorus, with everyone then coming in to sing the full chorus.</p><p>After the first chorus, an interlude comes in where Jinni demands the band to change it up, and thus the second section of the song begins. The second section of the song actually includes the part that has gone viral.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=big-wave-tiktok-lyrics-meaning></span>Big Wave TikTok Lyrics Meaning<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Big wave, big wave, 피하지 마 (<strong>Hey</strong>)</p><p>The Korean section of the lyric means “don’t dodge” which furthers the metaphor of the main song which revolves around “rolling the dice.”</p><p>It basically refers to living freely and without fearing life’s consequences. This section is also a rap verse but with a slower more typical Trap beat.</p><p>The second verse is followed by another interlude, which then leads to Lily, Haewoon, Sullyon, and Bae singing the bridge. The song then devolves into a Hyphy-inspired pre-chorus, interlude, and chorus that largely revolves around the bass and the horns, as each of the singers gets to show off their voice and get lyrics to sing and yell.</p><h2 id=nmixx-song-dice-becomes-a-tiktok-trend><span class=ez-toc-section id=big-wave-big-wave-by-nmixx-becomes-a-tiktok-trend></span> Big Wave Big Wave By NMIXX Becomes A TikTok Trend<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The NMIXX song Dice became a TikTok trend through the dance performed by the girls in the song.</p><p>At the beginning of the third verse, while singing “Big Wave” Kyujin starts doing a dance where she makes a wave motion with her hands while extending her legs to the side and then inwards. The singer then proceeds to wave her hands in front of her face.</p><p>Due to this dance portion coming right after the first big beat switch, and because the dance motions are very recognizable, it instantly became a hit amongst fans. NMIXX too worked at making this dance portion popular as they released various dance videos where they focused on this dance portion and this part of the song.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the sound that has become popular on TikTok is a slightly different version of the song. The TikTok version is a bass-boosted version that also mutes some of the synths.&nbsp;</p>@jeffreyarmani big wave ? Dc: @amour.jordynn ♬ BIG WAVE – CHAE ✩<p>The dance remains the same though, but some creators have started adding their own flairs to the dance. So far, the most popular video under the bass-boosted version of the song is by a TikTok dancer and dance-related creator named Jeffrey Armani with over 90.4K followers.</p><p>Armani’s video has received over 1.8 million views and well over 405.2K likes, with 6087 comments and 37.4K bookmarks. The TikTok creator’s dance is also slightly different than the one that NMIXX do in their video, but the comments show that people don’t mind his version either.</p>@_izwonnie_ It is kinda annoying that their calling it “Big Wave” and not atleast trying to look up the actual name of the song but its not that serious? #fyp #_izwonnie_ #foryou #bigwave #nmixx #dice #kpop #kpopfyp ♬ BIG WAVE – CHAE ✩<p>A sizeable number of NMIXX’s fandom have started showing offense to the fact that the song has become more popular as the Big Wave song, and many of the band’s fans have voiced their opinion, especially on TikTok.</p><p>The fandom seems to be split between one side which is thankful that the band is getting some sort of recognition and think the song’s nickname is annoying at best, while another side feels it is very disrespectful to the girl group, and even a bit racist.</p><h2 id=who-are-nmixx><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-are-nmixx></span> Who Are NMIXX?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>NMIXX is the girl group behind the song Dice which started the Big Wave trend.</p><p>The group consists of six members, Haewon, Lily, Sullywoon, Bae, Kyujin, and Bae. NMIXX was initially a septet, with Jinni, who has since, unfortunately, left the group.</p><p>NMIXX was formed by SQU4D, a sub-label of the popular entertainment group, JYP Entertainment. The group was announced on July 9, 2021, and fully debuted in February 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>The group’s name comes from the N meaning new, now, and next, alongside the word mix, which is meant to mean diversity and/or combination. The name is meant to define the girls as the best combination for a new era of South Korean K POP.</p><p>The girls were slowly introduced through a series of song covers and dance videos from August 6 to November 19, 2021. The girls were introduced in order Jinni, Jiwoo, Kyujin, Sullyoon, Bae, Haewoon, and Lily.&nbsp;</p><p>Haewoon is the leader of the group as well as a vocalist. Lily is the only one who is only a singer, while Sullywoon and Bae and vocalists and dancers, and Jiwoo and Kyujin are rappers, vocalists, and dancers.</p><p>NMIXX released their first single album, Ad Mare on February 22, 2022, to mixed reviews with many people loving their experimentation and others being put off by it. Sadly, they had to postpone any quick follow-up due to Bae testing positive for COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><p>As stated above, their second single album Entwuf came out on September 19, featuring Dice. The group started seeing a huge spike in interest around this time and released a Christmas song two months later.</p><p>Unfortunately, on December 9, 2022, Jinni left the group due to personal reasons. JYP Entertainment has stated that the group would continue as a six-piece, with their first EP, called Expergo, set to be released on March 20, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqZnHq4rdWeZK2hm6m8rHnSqKWgZZyuv6qv0maYp5xdqb%2BmusNmnLGonJa2r7HDaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbig-wave-tiktok-song-lyrics-and-trend-explained.html&text=Big%20Wave%20TikTok%20Song%20Lyrics%20and%20Trend%20Explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbig-wave-tiktok-song-lyrics-and-trend-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbig-wave-tiktok-song-lyrics-and-trend-explained.html&title=Big%20Wave%20TikTok%20Song%20Lyrics%20and%20Trend%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbig-wave-tiktok-song-lyrics-and-trend-explained.html&title=Big%20Wave%20TikTok%20Song%20Lyrics%20and%20Trend%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbig-wave-tiktok-song-lyrics-and-trend-explained.html&title=Big%20Wave%20TikTok%20Song%20Lyrics%20and%20Trend%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbig-wave-tiktok-song-lyrics-and-trend-explained.html&description=Big%20Wave%20TikTok%20Song%20Lyrics%20and%20Trend%20Explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./english-actress-bella-ramsey-hobby-acting-career-hbo-game-of-thrones-lyanna-mormont.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="English Actress, Bella Ramsey hobby for acting led her in Acting since her early life.
