One wants the actors to succeed even after the show ends or their tenure on the series does. One such show is <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NYPD Blue</a></strong> which was created by Steven Bochco and David Milch. Milch’s inspiration for the series was his friendship with Bill Clark, a former NYC Cop, who eventually consulted on the show as a producer.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=315 data-current-count=315 data-injectable=false>It premiered on ABC on Sept. 21, 1993, and ran until March 1, 2005, holding the title of the longest-running drama for the network until Grey’s Anatomy took it in 2016. Over the course of the series, audiences were introduced to many talented actors who went on to do great things. Here’s a look at ten of them.</p><h2 id=h-dennis-franz data-injectable=false>Dennis Franz</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=615 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=258 data-injectable=false>Dennis Franz played Detective Andy Sipowicz of the 15th Precinct of the NYPD for all 12 seasons of the show appearing in 261 episodes. Post Blue he retired from acting and is enjoying the good life which includes plenty of time outdoors and with his family.</p><p data-characters=258 data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true>“I just wanted to live an enjoyable, irresponsible, spend-time-with-my-family kind of life. I haven’t regretted one minute of it. I’m pretty good at doing nothing,” he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Post</a> in 2015. After all that work on the series, he deserves it.</p><h2 id=h-austin-majors data-injectable=false>Austin Majors</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=741 data-current-count=1041 data-injectable=true>Franz’s on-screen son Theo Sipowicz was played by Austin Majors. Unfortunately, his story after the series is not as happy as his fictional father’s. In February of 2023, he was found dead at the age of 27. The investigation into his death is still ongoing but authorities are calling it a “suspected fentanyl poisoning.”</p><p>Franz found Major’s death hard to process. “I was so shocked and saddened to hear of Austin’s passing. Austin was always such a joy to have on the set, he brought smiles and happiness to everyone. Although we haven’t stayed in touch since the show ended in 2005, I will always remember him fondly. My love and condolences to his family,” he wrote in a statement to<a href=#> Fox News Digital.</a></p><h2 id=h-david-caruso data-injectable=false>David Caruso</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=595 data-current-count=895 data-injectable=true>Actor David Caruso did not have a long tenure on Blue. He played Detective John Kelly for only two seasons and was not easy to get along with on set. “Caruso felt he was too good for television…He wanted to be a movie star. And his plan was to alienate the writers, producers, and his fellow castmates in hopes that we would dump him from the show,”<a href=#> stated creator Steven Bochco</a>. David got his wish. John Kelly was said to be working as a private security advisor overseas and that was that. Post Blue Caruso would go on to tackle another procedural drama, the CBS series CSI: Miami.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-gordon-clapp data-injectable=false>Gordon Clapp</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=309 data-current-count=609 data-injectable=true>Gordon Clapp played Detective Greg Medavoy for all 12 seasons of the show and even won an Emmy award for it. He was a recurring character in season one before being bumped to series regular in season two. He continued to act post Blue appearing as the recurring character of Chaplain Orlovsky on Chicago Fire.</p><h2 id=h-james-mcdaniel data-injectable=false>James McDaniel</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=265 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>Actor James McDaniel played Captain Arthur Fancy for eight seasons of Blue. He seems to like cop roles because he appeared in an unsuccessful series called Cop Rock before landing the role of Sgt. Jesse Longford in ABC’s Detroit 1-8-7. If it works, stick with it.</p><h2 id=h-bill-brochtrup data-injectable=false>Bill Brochtrup</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Actor Bill Brochtrup played John Irvin, a homosexual police administrative aide. The role was personal to Bill because he is gay in real life. Since Blue wrapped he has appeared on Dexter and Shameless. He also appeared as the recurring character Dr. Joe Bowman on Major Crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-nicholas-turturro data-injectable=false>Nicholas Turturro</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=342 data-current-count=642 data-injectable=true>The character of James Martinez was played by Nicholas Turturro. James was brought into the 15th to cover for Sipowicz when he got shot. Since Blue, Turturro has appeared in the films I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry, Here Comes the Boom, and Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2. He also portrayed Sgt. Anthony Renzulli on Blue Bloods from 2010-2016.</p><h2 id=h-kim-delaney data-injectable=false>Kim Delaney</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=290 data-current-count=590 data-injectable=true>Kim Delaney portrayed Detective Diane Russell who suffered from alcoholism and a dysfunctional family life. After Blue, she starred in the short-lived series Philly. She worked with John Kelly on CSI: Miami then found a home for six seasons on Lifetime’s Army Wives as Claudia Joy Holden.</p><h2 id=h-sharon-lawrence data-injectable=false>Sharon Lawrence</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=734 data-injectable=true>The character of Sylvia Costas brings in the legal side of the series. Law and order do work closely with one another. She was the Assistant District Attorney and was played by Sharon Lawrence. She has an impressive resume since leaving the series with appearances on The Ranch, Shameless, On Becoming a God in Central Florida, Dynasty, and Criminal Minds. In 2009 she was nominated for an Emmy Award for her work on Grey’s Anatomy.</p><h2 id=h-jimmy-smits data-injectable=false>Jimmy Smits</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=655 data-injectable=false>Jimmy Smits essentially replaced David Caruso&nbsp;as Bobby Simone. It takes a minute for Andy Sipowicz to warm up to his new partner but they pair quickly flourish working together. Smit compiled a lengthy resume since the show’s ending appearing on The West Wing, Cane, Dexter, Outlaw, Sons of Anarchy, The Get Down, and 24: Legacy to name just a few.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSrnKxlpJ2ybq%2FArKtmp5Ziu7q8w2aZpa2VYruww44%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwheres-the-cast-of-nypd-blue-now.html&text=Wheres%20the%20cast%20of%20NYPD%20Blue%20now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwheres-the-cast-of-nypd-blue-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwheres-the-cast-of-nypd-blue-now.html&title=Wheres%20the%20cast%20of%20NYPD%20Blue%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwheres-the-cast-of-nypd-blue-now.html&title=Wheres%20the%20cast%20of%20NYPD%20Blue%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwheres-the-cast-of-nypd-blue-now.html&title=Wheres%20the%20cast%20of%20NYPD%20Blue%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwheres-the-cast-of-nypd-blue-now.html&description=Wheres%20the%20cast%20of%20NYPD%20Blue%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./univ-of-new-mexico-tight-end-jaden-hullaby-dead-at-21-texas-longhorns.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                              Univ.
