That being said, it would interest you to know that Blake Shelton has been a judge/coach on The Voice for over a decade.</p><p>His dominance on the hit reality TV singing competition is unrivaled, with twice the number of victories as the next best coach in the person of Kelly Clarkson, who has racked up four wins in her seven seasons on the show, including an unprecedented group victory. Read on to find out how Blake Shelton secured eight wins as a coach on The Voice.</p><h2><strong>How Many Seasons Of The Voice Has Blake Shelton Won?</strong></h2><p>Blake Shelton’s team has come out on top on 8 out of 21 different occasions of The Voice, and he has done so with different groups of talented singers who have withstood the rigorous screening processes that make the show one of the most challenging singing competitions to win. Let’s meet the various teams he used to pull off these victories.</p><h3><strong>Blake Shelton Won His First The Voice With Jermaine Paul in Season 2 (2012)</strong></h3><h4><strong>Artists On The Team</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Jermaine Paul</strong></li><li>Erin Willett</li><li>Rael Lynn</li><li>Jordis Unga</li><li>Charlotte Sometimes</li><li>Naia Kete</li></ul><p>Blake Shelton’s first win came in only the show’s second season. It is noteworthy that he did it with the kind of artist he usually doesn’t work with, in the person of R&B singer Jermaine Paul. One of Blake Shelton’s greatest assets is that he understands how pivotal the choice of song could be in the grand scheme of things.</p><p>It is a vital trait that he shares with Adam Levine, although he has been more successful at it.&nbsp;Jermaine Paul sang Avril Lavigne’s Complicated at his blind audition, and for the finals, he sang R. Kelly’s I Believe I Can Fly, Blake Shelton’s God Gave Me You before finishing with Soul Man for the grand prize. Clearly unsatisfied with his performance, Jermaine Paul expressed his surprise at emerging victorious.</p><h3><strong>Cassadee Pope Brought Blake Shelton His Second Win In Season 3 (2012)</strong></h3><h4><strong>Artists On The Team</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Cassadee Pope</strong></li><li>Terry McDermott</li><li>Michaela Paige</li><li>Julio Cesar Castillo</li><li>Liz Davis</li></ul><p>Blake Shelton became the first coach on The Voice to register back-to-back victories after the world witnessed the triumph of pop-punk singer Cassadee Pope over several other talented singers. Shelton quickly pointed out that Pope’s versatility was her biggest selling point.</p><p>For her blind audition, Cassadee Pope chose Torn before serenading the audience with Not Over You, Over You, My Happy Ending, Hazel Eyes, and Stupid Boy, among others, in the weeks that followed. She took home the crown with a perfect rendition of Cry after performing Over You and Steve McQueen in the finals.</p><h3><strong>Blake Shelton’s Third Win Was With Danielle Bradberry in Season 4 (2013)</strong></h3><h4><strong>Artists On The Team</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Danielle Bradberry</strong></li><li>The Swon Brothers</li><li>Holly Tucker</li><li>Justin Rivers</li></ul><p>16-year-old country pop singer Danielle Bradberry helped Blake Shelton extend his record as he became the first coach to have a hat-trick of wins on The Voice. Her victory left her speechless and in tears before she found the words to convey how thankful and, yes, you guessed it, speechless she was.&nbsp;Danielle Bradberry sang Mean at her blind audition to the delight of Shelton, who was so delighted when the then-teenager agreed to be on his team.</p><p>Under Blake’s coaching and guidance, Bradberry performed songs such as Jesus Take The Wheel, Shake The Sugar Tree, and Maybe It Was Memphis on her way to the finals, where she subsequently performed Timber, I’m Falling In Love. She clinched the ultimate prize money of $100k with a measured Born to Fly.</p><h3><strong>Craig Wayne Boyd Brought Blake Shelton Another Win in The Voice, Season 7 (2014)</strong></h3><h4><strong>Artists On The Team</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Craig Wayne Boyd</strong></li><li>Reagan James</li><li>Jessie Pitts</li><li>Taylor Bashears</li></ul><p>Blake had to go through the unfamiliar experience of watching Adam Levine and Usher scoop up the seasons 5 & 6 crowns. By the time the seventh season rolled around in 2014, Blake was ready to reclaim his crown, and so he did when country singer Craig Wayne Boyd romped to victory with My Baby’s Got A Smile On Her Face and Boots On in the grand finale of the show’s season 7.</p><p>The country singer, who credits Shelton for advising him to be himself and not let anyone change him, helped Blake to his fourth victory in just seven seasons of the show.</p><h3><strong>Sundance Head, Season 11 (2016)</strong></h3><h4><strong>Artists On The Team</strong></h4><ul><li><strong>Sundance Head</strong></li><li>Austin Allsup</li><li>Courtney Harrell</li><li>Dana Harper</li><li>Jason Warrior</li></ul><p>Shelton had to wait four additional seasons before claiming his 5th win as a coach when yet another country singer known as Sundance Head blew everyone away with his rendition of powerful songs such as Me and Jesus, Love Can Build A Bridge, and At Last.</p><h3><strong>Chloe Kohanski, Season 13 (2017)</strong></h3><p><strong>Artists On The Team</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Chloe Kohanski</strong></li><li>Red Marlow</li><li>Keisha Renee</li><li>Mitchell Lee</li><li>Natalie Stovall</li><li>Esera Tuaolo</li></ul><p>Shelton’s sixth win as a coach came in 2017 when rock singer Chloe Kohanski pipped everyone to the prize after performing The Chain, I Am Woman, Landslide, and Time After Time on her way to the crown. Chloe revealed that The Voice allowed her to make her parents proud, and boy did she! She also praised Blake for keeping to his word about taking care of his team.</p><h3><strong>Todd Tilghman, Season 18 (2020)</strong></h3><p><strong>Artists On The Team</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Todd Tilghman</strong></li><li>Toneisha Harris</li><li>Joanna Serenko</li><li>Joei Fulco</li></ul><p>Blake Shelton’s seventh victory arrived on the shoulders of pastor, singer, and father of eight, Todd Tilghman. He was 42 years old at the time, and that age milestone bestowed him with the privilege and honor of being the oldest person to win the show in its long and storied history.</p><p>He brought home the prize with a soulful rendition of I Can Only Imagine. Shelton had nothing but complimentary words for Todd after his win and even wished he had a record label he could sign Todd to and make him a priority.</p><h3><strong>Recently, Cam Anthony Delivered Another Win for Blake Shelton in The Voice Season 20 (2021)</strong></h3><p>Blake’s eighth and most recent win came in 2021 at the show’s 20th season. He extended his lead over the next best judge when then 19-year-old Cam Anthony brought down the house with a rousing rendition of Stand Up to crown his efforts. The young singer expressed his gratitude to Blake for reposing a lot of faith in his vocal abilities, as that faith gave him the wings to fly to the top of the Season 20 perch.</p><h2><strong>How Long Has Blake Shelton Been On The Voice?</strong></h2><p>Blake Shelton has been a coach/judge on The Voice for over a decade. He was among the first four judges, alongside CeeLo Green, Adam Levine, and Christina Aguilera, to preside over the show when it first premiered in April 2011. The first 16 seasons saw Blake and Adam sharing the infamous red chair as the two longest-serving judges.</p><p>Blake became the outright mainstay when Levine withdrew without any heads up after the 16 seasons of the show. A skit revealed Blake referring to an alleged clause in his contract, which put him in charge at The Voice after his 10th consecutive year on the show. He proposed several changes, including making the red chair more comfortable and changing the show’s name to Blake Shelton’s The Voice.</p><h2><strong>Is Blake Shelton Leaving The Voice?</strong></h2><p>Blake Shelton is not leaving The Voice at the moment. To allay fears that the show’s longest-serving coach/judge would be leaving the show, the producers have quickly announced that along with John Legend, Camila Cabello, and Blake’s wife Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton would be returning as the fourth judge/coach for the show’s 22nd episode which is scheduled to premiere on September 9, 2022.</p><p>In the past, the country singer has spoken about leaving the show to spend more time with his wife, Gwen Stefani, but has continually changed his mind for various reasons. Lovers of the show will hope that the rumors about the producers wanting to replace Blake with a younger judge like Ariana Grande are not true and that Blake would continue to be on a show he has helped to make one of the best in the United States and the world at large.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLWww4ymmKexXam2rrHSZp%2Baq12XuaK3xGaqoZ2cqbyvedaopWasmJp6t7vInJxo</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-many-times-has-blake-shelton-won-the-voice.html&text=How%20Many%20Times%20Has%20Blake%20Shelton%20Won%20The%20Voice%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-many-times-has-blake-shelton-won-the-voice.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-many-times-has-blake-shelton-won-the-voice.html&title=How%20Many%20Times%20Has%20Blake%20Shelton%20Won%20The%20Voice%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-many-times-has-blake-shelton-won-the-voice.html&title=How%20Many%20Times%20Has%20Blake%20Shelton%20Won%20The%20Voice%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-many-times-has-blake-shelton-won-the-voice.html&title=How%20Many%20Times%20Has%20Blake%20Shelton%20Won%20The%20Voice%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-many-times-has-blake-shelton-won-the-voice.html&description=How%20Many%20Times%20Has%20Blake%20Shelton%20Won%20The%20Voice%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./angels-and-tomboys-net-worth-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hows the Shark Tank Brand Doing?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./felipe-melo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Felipe Melo">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
