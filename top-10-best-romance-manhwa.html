From <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">your typical historical romance</a> to highly convoluted psychological thrillers, the truth is – you will find any trope that you want in romance manhwa.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true>This pluralism of genres, as well as the colorful strips with gorgeous art attached to their names, is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">what made this format so popular in the first place</a> after all. On that note, for any romance aficionados out there, here is the perfect romance manhwa list to spend idling time away and falling in love.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>23.

If you’re into stories about idols, celebrities, and the whole shebang of a handsome actor falling in love with someone outside of the glamorous world, then this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WEBTOON</a> manhwa is tailor-made for you. The story sees the romance between Yura, an aspiring actress with a minor role in a film, and Seunghyeon, the main (and incredibly famous) actor from the same movie. It’s a refreshing romance that skips unnecessary drama, making it perfect for a one-sit read.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>22.

Crafted by the creative mind behind Cheese in the Trap, the story revolves around Mi-ae and Cheol, two middle school students with starkly different personalities who hadn’t crossed paths since childhood. Their story is a delightful blend of humor and realism, making it an exceptionally cute manhwa overall.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>20. December Rain (2017-2019)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/December-Rain.jpg><ul data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true><li>Strangers to lovers</li><li>Drama</li><li>Tragedy</li></ul><p data-characters=475 data-current-count=475 data-injectable=true>Even if it is at the bottom of the list (because I just can’t place all of these in the first place), <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lezhin</a>‘s December Rain is the one romance that will make you rethink the meaning of happiness.
