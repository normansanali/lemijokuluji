Her breakthrough came with the album My Kind of Country in 1984, which featured the hit single "How Blue."</p><p>Reba McEntire's talents extend beyond music into the world of acting. In 2001, she made her mark on television by starring in her own sitcom, Reba. The show ran for six seasons and featured McEntire as a single mother navigating the challenges of life with humor and grace. Her performance earned her critical acclaim and further expanded her fan base.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Reba is currently sitting at nearly 9 figures, with a staggering $95 million net worth.</p><p>Music and acting aside, real estate has played a part in her net worth growth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"In 2003, Reba and Narvel spent $9 million to buy a 2-acre property in Beverly Hills. In 2015, around the time of their divorce, they sold the property – which features a 9,000 square-foot mansion – for $22.5 million. They also owned an 80-acre farm called Starstruck Farm in Gallatin, Tennessee, 30 minutes northeast of Nashville. The property features an 12,800 square-foot lakefront house, large pool, pool house, equestrian facilities and tennis courts. In September 2016 they listed the home for $7.9 million.

Narvel Blackstock, my manager and husband at the time — we got a divorce, and the shocker of it all was, there were four people who were taking care of all my business," she says of the experience. (PEOPLE has an exclusive first listen.) "I had my production manager who left, I had my CEO who left, my manager and husband, and my father had died. So four men who were rock and pillars of my world were gone," she said.</p><p>Because of this massive change, Reba was forced to evaluate her finances, and figure out what to do.</p><p>"I started taking over signing the checks and then I started realizing how much water cost, and the electric bill, and all the things that was going on in my life.

I had to say, 'OK big boy, I can't handle this. This is way over my pay grade — I don't know what to do.' And I would wait, and He would guide me. And so without my faith, I have no idea where I would be or my career would be, at this time today," she said.</p><p>The selfless star even had some advice for others going through their own personal valleys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/reba-show.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Reba Made Extra Profits Off Syndication, But A Former Showrunner Claims The Revenue Was Split Unfairly</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>A former Reba employee was seeking over $1 million in damages from her time on the show behind the scenes.</span><p>"If someone walked up to me and said, 'Reba, I'm going through a situation like you did — what's your advice?'
