full name Francisco Guillermo Ochoa Magaaa - is currently playing in Liga MX (Mexico's top division).</p><p>He is captain of Mexico City side Club America and has been plying his trade in his native country since moving from Standard Liege in 2019.</p><p>Ochoa came through the professional ranks at America and during his first stint he became the first Mexican to be nominated for the Ballon d'Or in 2007.</p><p>Throughout his career, he's travelled to Europe to play for Ligue 1 team Ajaccio and spent three years in Spain at Malaga and Granada.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2022/07/a43a6cd8-6705-447a-83d5-cd77f74ffac3.jpg><p>Yet the fact Ochoa never turned out for an elite European side may have been a surprise to fans who have watched him become the best goalkeeper in the world every four years.</p><p>He was one of five Mexico players who tested positive for clenbuterol in 2011 - they were cleared two months later but the saga cost him a proposed move to Paris Saint-Germain.</p><p>Ochoa's heroics in 2014 raised hopes of a revival at club level, with Arsenal among the Premier League teams interested in him.</p><p>But instead he found himself signing for Malaga in a move that proved disastrous as he spent most of the time on the bench.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2018/07/BrazilMexicoOchoaSavesNeymar.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Football</h2></p><p>Ochoa's club career may not have hit the heights he would have wanted but on the international stage it's a different story.</p><p>The Guadalajara-born superstar made his debut for his country in 2005 and is their most-capped goalkeeper with 130 outings.</p><p>And that is despite the fact that he was called up to the 2006 and 2010 World Cup squads but failed to make a single appearance.</p><p>In 2014, it was Ochoa's time to shine as he produced a man of the match display to keep a clean sheet in a 0-0 draw with Brazil.</p><p>He made six saves, including two stunning stops to deny Neymar and Fred, and ultimately conceded just once in three group games as Mexico qualifed as runners-up.</p><p>Ochoa then collected another Man of the Match award for the last-16 game against Netherlands, but was powerless to stop Klaas-Jan Huntelaar scoring a stoppage-time penalty winner.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2014/06/guillermo-ochoa_1.jpg><p>Ochoa returned to Russia 2018 with a vengeance following that defeat, making 25 saves in only FOUR games for Mexico.</p><p>Only Thibaut Courtois made more in the tournament overall and Belgium played three more matches having reached the semi-finals and then played in a third-placed playoff.</p><p>Mexico are now set to face Argentina in Group C in what will be Lionel Messi's final dance as well -
