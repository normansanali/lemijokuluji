While Perry has been open about some aspects of his life, there is still some speculation about his romantic relationships and sexual orientation.</p><p>One question that has come up frequently is whether Matthew Perry was gay or had a wife. Perry has never publicly identified as gay, but there have been rumors and speculation about his sexuality over the years. In 2019, a book claimed that Perry refused a “Friends” storyline that involved Chandler sneaking into a gay bar, which led to some criticism of the actor. However, it’s important to note that Perry has never confirmed or denied these rumors, and his sexual orientation is ultimately a private matter.</p><p>Another aspect of Perry’s personal life that has been the subject of speculation is his relationship status. Perry has been linked to several women over the years, including actresses Neve Campbell and Heather Graham. He was also in a long-term relationship with literary manager Molly Hurwitz, and the two were engaged for a time before calling it off in 2021. While Perry has never been married, he has been open about his desire to start a family, and has spoken about his struggles with addiction and mental health.</p><h2><span id=Matthew_Perrys_Personal_Life>Matthew Perry’s Personal Life</span></h2><p>Matthew Perry, the beloved American-Canadian actor, comedian, and producer, passed away on October 28, 2023.

Despite rumors and speculation about his sexuality, Perry identified as straight and never publicly discussed any attraction to men.</p><p>There have been reports that Perry was uncomfortable with a storyline on the popular TV show Friends that involved his character, Chandler Bing, sneaking into a gay bar. However, it is important to note that this does not necessarily indicate that Perry was homophobic or had any issues with the LGBTQ+ community. It is possible that he simply did not feel comfortable with the storyline for personal reasons.</p><p>In 2022, Perry revealed that he suffered from impotence during his early sexual experiences, which caused him shame and embarrassment.
