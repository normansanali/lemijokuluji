Despite his failed romances, the father of three children is currently in a good position with a new partnership.</strong></p><p>Many of you are already aware of this, but there are some details concerning his personal life that you should be aware of. Today, we’ll tell you all you need to know about his previous marriages, children, and dating history. Beginning with his first romance and progressing to his present one.</p><h2><span id=Lionel_Richie8217s_Relationship_With_His_First_Wife_Brenda_Harvey-Richie>Lionel Richie’s Relationship With His First Wife, Brenda Harvey-Richie</span></h2><p>On October 18, 1975, Lionel married his first wife, Brenda Harvey-Richie. It was a tiny wedding ceremony, with only close friends and family present.</p><p>When it comes to how the two originally met, they met while attending the same high school. Since they began dating, Richie and Brenda have enjoyed a profound love and affection.</p><p>However, things were not always great. Lionel’s relationship was put to the test when he went on tour with his previous band, the Commodores.</p><p>Their romantic love story was on the edge of ending due to a lack of communication between them. Nonetheless, things improved once Lionel returned from his tour and proposed to his then-girlfriend and soon-to-be wife.</p><h2><span id=Lionel_and_Brenda_have_adopted_a_daughter>Lionel and Brenda have adopted a daughter.</span></h2><p>Lionel and Brenda had been married for some years but had failed to have children. Then a couple requested them to look after Nicole, their three-year-old daughter. So Nicole Richie (formerly Escovedo) entered their lives around a decade after their wedding.</p><p>She was the biological daughter of Richie’s bandmates Peter Michael Escovedo and Karen Moss. Nicole’s parents were going through personal and financial difficulties, so they opted to entrust her care to the Richies.</p><p>Lionel Richie Has a Daughter Nicole Richie is a celebrity. Nicole Richie was adopted by Lionel and his first wife. Lionel said during an interview with Piers Morgan,</p><p>“It took me about a year to just fall in love [with Nicole].” Of course, I was ‘Dad’ by then… ‘Let’s adopt her,’ I said.</p><p>Nicole was legally adopted by Lionel and Brenda when she was nine years old. Their daughter established her career in the entertainment sector. She is most known for her role in the reality show The Simple Life. Paris Hilton, a close friend of hers, also starred in the film.</p><p>Nicole is happily married to Joel Madden and has two children, Harlow and Sparrow.</p><h2><span id=Brenda_Harvey_filed_for_divorce_from_Lionel_after_he_cheated_on_her>Brenda Harvey filed for divorce from Lionel after he cheated on her.</span></h2><p>Brenda and Lionel’s relationship reached rock bottom in the late 1980s. In 1988, she discovered Lionel and his mistress Diane Alexander at the latter’s Beverly Hills residence. Brenda entered the room about 2 a.m. on June 29th, claiming she had come for room service. She took Lionel and Diane off guard.</p><p>She then began hitting Lionel and even dropped kicked him in the belly. Richie soon left the flat, while Brenda began assaulting Diane, who was 22 at the time. At the time, a neighbor told PEOPLE Magazine,</p><p>“Lionel was present, and it was clear that his wife had just discovered him with Diane. His wife was enraged. Inside, glass shattered and furniture smashed. She sounded like she was murdering someone. It wasn’t quite sophisticated.”</p><p>Brenda was later charged with causing bodily harm to a husband, resisting arrest, vandalism, and domestic violence. Their marriage had begun to deteriorate after Lionel met Diane, his second wife. He had been sneaking into Diane’s apartment through the back door for the last few years, before the major event.</p><p>Following that, on August 9, 1993, Lionel and Brenda formally divorced after 18 years of marriage.</p><p>In 1995, Lionel married his second wife, Diane Alexander: She has two children with her.</p><p>Richie married his lover, Diane, after finalizing his divorce from his first wife. They married on December 21, 1996.</p><p>Initially, the two met during the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. Diane was one of the dancers performing during the song when Richie sang at the event. In addition, a few years later, in 1986, she starred in the video for Richie’s smash song Dancing on the Ceiling.</p><h2><span id=The_second_wife_of_Lionel_Richie_Alexander_Diane>The second wife of Lionel Richie Alexander, Diane</span></h2><p>Lionel Richie and Diane Alexander, his second wife.</p><p>Lionel and Diane had been dating even when he was still married to his wife. Diane moved in with Lionel after Lionel and Brenda divorced in 1992.</p><p>On May 27, 1994, Diane gave birth to their first child, a boy called Miles Brockman. On August 24, 1998, four years later, Sofia Richie arrived.</p><h2><span id=Children_of_Lionel_Richie>Children of Lionel Richie</span></h2><p>Sofia and Lionel are Lionel and Diane’s two children.</p><p>Lionel and Diane divorced in 2003: The Divorce Settlement</p><p>After only eight years of marriage, the lovebirds decided to divorce. Diane filed for divorce in January 2004, alleging irreconcilable differences.</p><p>Several tabloids suggest they married in 1995, however, Diane’s divorce papers show it was definitely in 1996.</p><p>Lionel and Diane married in 1996, not 1995, according to the divorce decree.</p><p>What truly set the entertainment world on fire was the Richie family’s opulent lifestyle, as detailed in Diane’s divorce papers. According to the divorce papers, the family used to spend more than $300,000 a month on costs. Similarly, she requested $300,000 in monthly spousal maintenance as well as custody of her children.</p><p>Their divorce was formalized a few months later. Diane was awarded a whopping $20 million. Alimony payments included $15,000 each month for shopping, $50,000 for personal services, and a $20,000 allowance for cosmetic surgery.</p><h2><span id=Lionel_is_dating_Lisa_Parigi_who_is_at_least_three_decades_her_junior>Lionel is dating Lisa Parigi, who is at least three decades her junior.</span></h2><p>Lionel has been in a loving relationship with his businesswoman and model girlfriend, Lisa Parigi, since roughly 2014. Even though the lovebirds appear to have a significant age gap, it has yet to cause any pressure in their relationship.</p><p>When it comes to Lisa, she is of mixed Swiss, Caribbean, and Chinese ancestry. She also speaks four languages: German, French, Swiss-German, and English.</p><p>Meanwhile, Richie is eager to start a family with his girlfriend Lisa. In 2016, he told Mirror, “I’m willing to become a father again.” I may have accidentally revealed a secret there, but Lisa and I are fine with the thought of having children.”</p><p>If they are receptive to the prospect of having children, then marriage may not be long behind.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Mahbod Moghadam, Kwhxte, and Renata Jara."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4224,"10":2,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":26}{"1":28,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":34}{"1":40,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":51}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/mahbod-moghadam/"}{"1":26}{"1":28,"2":"https://popularbio.com/kwhxte/"}{"1":34}{"1":40,"2":"https://popularbio.com/renata-jara/"}{"1":51}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Mahbod Moghadam</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Kwhxte</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Renata Jara</a>.</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Singer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Meet Paul Rouleau Wife | Suzette Trudeau | Relationship & Family</a></h3>In 2006, Paul Rouleau's wife, Julie Rouleau, gave a $100 contribution to federal Liberal leadership contender Gerard Kennedy.
