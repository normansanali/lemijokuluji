Five days later, those words came to chilling fruition.</p><p class=Xg>Prince was one of the greatest performers the world of entertainment will ever have the privilege of seeing on stage. He lived an exciting life, but his girlfriend Judith Hill, who he was dating when he died, once revealed that the talented artist had been depressed during the final days preceding his demise.</p><p class=Xg>Hill <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5653029/Prince-said-soul-left-body-previous-overdose-complained-life-boring.html>told </a>investigators that Prince told her his soul left his body during an overdose that would have claimed his life had it not been for the intervention of health personnel.</p><p class=_i data-testid=image-source>Prince Rogers Nelson at Madame Tussauds Las Vegas NV, USA 09-30-18 | Photo: Shutterstock</p><p class=Xg>According to what Hill told the Carver County Sheriff's Office, Prince had been feeling quite blue on the night of what would become his final performance in Atlanta on April 16.</p><p class=Xg>She said he had not been feeling well until after his first show, which was amazing. After it ended, he returned to his dressing home, but when she praised him for the incredible show, he talked about how he enjoyed "sleeping more."</p><p class=Xg>While she listened, he speculated that it meant he had fulfilled his purpose on earth. When Hill asked him if he enjoyed being on earth while awake, he said it had become "incredibly boring."</p><h3 class=bh><strong class=Vg>She told his manager to have him see a doctor before she finally left him to fly home.</strong></h3><p class=Xg>The singer had also reportedly tagged his final show a "mountain top" performance, telling Hill, "now I can go away." After the show, Hill, Prince, and his assistant Kirk Johnson headed back to Minneapolis. They boarded their private aircraft, which is where things got weird.</p><p class=Xg>According to Hill, Prince wanted her to stay with him in Paisley Park for another day so they could watch movies and hang out for a while. It was just moments before Prince's overdose.</p><p class=Xg>It happened after he took some bites of the food he had been served. Hill heard water spilling from a bottle Prince held, after which she noticed that he was still and unmoving.</p><p class=Xg>She notified Johnson, who convinced the pilots to land the plane because Prince had no heartbeat. They landed in Illinois, where emergency vehicles were waiting.</p><p class=Xg>According to paramedics, he took four breaths a minute, so they gave him two milligrams of the opioid antidote naloxone, aka Narcan, which is twice the amount used to revive a "casual" drug user.</p><p class=Xg>When that did not work, they administered another 2-milligram dosage. <a class="ie l" href=#>Prince </a>was tight-lipped about what he took, and he refused blood tests, but he gave Hill a recap of his experience.</p><p class=Xg>"I left. My soul left. I could hear you, I could hear everybody talking, and I kept saying, 'how am I going to get back to my body,' and it was the hardest thing," Hill <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5653029/Prince-said-soul-left-body-previous-overdose-complained-life-boring.html>recalled</a>.</p><p class=Xg>She tried to discourage him from taking more pills, but then he revealed that he wouldn't be able to perform because his hands were hurting.</p><p class=Xg>Hill got even more worried when Prince started to justify his overdose. She told his manager to have him see a doctor before she finally left him to fly home.</p><p class=Xg>She said his last words to her were, "it feels like your stay here was too short." It was the last time she saw him alive.
