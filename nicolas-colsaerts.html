His season was less successful in the US, where he was cut 7 times in 12 events and lost his tour membership.</p><p>In 2013, Colsaerts played on both the European and PGA Tour; in the US, he finished tenth at the U.S. Open, 8th at the Zurich Classic of New Orleans and reached round of 16 of the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. With a final 128th place in the FedEx Cup he missed the end of season playoffs, but was able to retain his membership thanks to his 114th place in the money list. He collected five top-10 finishes in the European Tour, with a fifth place at the Italian Open as best result.</p><p>In May 2012, he won his biggest career title at the Volvo World Match Play Championship. He beat <a href=#>Graeme McDowell</a>, 1 up, in the final and was never behind in the match at any point. On his way to the title he also beat <a href=#>Justin Rose</a> 4&3, <a href=#>Brandt Snedeker</a> 4&3, and <a href=#>Paul Lawrie</a> at the 20th hole in the semi-finals, after beginning four down after four holes. Prior to all of this, he had only just advanced from the group stage after defeating <a href=#>Charl Schwartzel</a> at the first playoff hole. Colsaerts entered the top 50 in the world after his win took him to world number 32.</p><p>Colsaerts played in the 2012 U.S. Open at the Olympic Club and made the cut for the first time in a major championship, going on to finish tied 27th.

He then reached the semi-finals of the 2011 Volvo World Match Play Championship in Spain, losing to eventual winner <a href=#>Ian Poulter</a> after a playoff hole in the semi-finals.

He finished the season ranked 20th in the Race to Dubai to secure invitations to at least two majors in 2012.</p><p>Colsaerts nearly won the 2009 Challenge of Ireland after a final round 68, but lost at the third hole of a sudden-death playoff to English golfer <a href=#>Robert Coles</a>.

Colsaerts continued to play on the European Tour throughout in next four seasons.</p><p>He turned professional in 2000, the day of his 18th birthday, with a +5 handicap.</p><p>Three days after turning professional Colsaerts entered 2000 Qualifying School where he gained his European Tour card.</p><p>Nicolas Colsaerts (14 November 1982) is a Belgian professional golfer currently playing on the European Tour and previously on the PGA Tour.</p><p>Colsaerts, also known as "The Belgian Bomber", was born in Schaerbeek, Belgium.
