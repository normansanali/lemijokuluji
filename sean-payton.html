But we do want to get a test on that.’”</p><p>When asked about those who are ignoring government recommendations for self-isolation and avoiding large gatherings, Payton expressed disappointment.</p><p>“We all have someone that we know very closely — for me it’s, my parents are both deceased — but elderly people who are close to us. The idea that you could be invincible when you’re younger, first off there are younger people who are dying from this virus.</p><p>“And then the idea that you could transmit or carry this to someone who isn’t healthy enough to withstand it, or even a healthcare worker that we need to take care of someone close to us.</p><p>So I think the minute people start looking not only close to home, but man there is some common sense here, and there is too much science and too much data for us to be ignoring that.

The team had to play in the opening round of the playoffs and the Vikings at home upset it.</p><p>In the NFC, the team defeated New Orleans with tie-breakers to the other two teams with that record.</p><p>As Payton enters the 2020 campaign, he continues to represent the Saints as the model of stability not only within the NFC South, as he is the longest-tenured head coach within the division.</p><p>But also in the NFL as only New England’s Bill Belichick (2000) has been with his team longer.
