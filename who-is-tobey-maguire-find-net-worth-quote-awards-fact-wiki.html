To most people, Tobey Maguire is perhaps best known for playing the character of Peter Parker in the “Spider Man” movies, directed by Sam Raimi. The first film in the trilogy entitled “Spider-Man” came out in 2002 to largely favorable critical reviews. The movie proved to be so popular that it managed to gross more than $100 million during its debut weekend, while it earned a total of $821 million at the box office overall. Aside from Maguire, the main cast included Willem Dafoe, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. The popularity of the first film inspired the release of “Spider-Man 2”, which turned out to be yet another critical and commercial success. In addition to grossing more than $783 million worldwide, “Spider-Man 2” earned five Saturn Awards, and received the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects. The trilogy finished off with “Spider-Man 3”, released in 2007, which aside from Peter Parker, introduced a new character under the name of “Venom”, played by Topher Grace. Unlike the first two films, “Spider-Man 3” failed to repeat the success in terms of critical reviews and audience approval. Many critics were displeased with the lack of storyline in the movie, and the introduction of too many comic book characters. Nevertheless, “Spider-Man 3” managed to gross more than $890 million at the box office, making it the highest-grossing film in the series. Needless to say that Maguire, who played the main character of the trilogy, received a lot of public attention due to the popularity of “Spider-Man”.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=tobey-maguire-net-worth-75-million></span>Tobey Maguire Net Worth $75 Million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>A well-known actor, how rich is Tobey Maguire?

Maguire took up drama classes in high school, but he eventually dropped his studies, and went directly into acting instead. Maguire made his debut in Todd Holland’s comedy-drama film called “The Wizard”, where he starred alongside Fred Savage, Jenny Lewis and Luke Edwards. He then made numerous appearances in advertisements, until he was offered an opportunity to play the main character in the sitcom entitled “Great Scott!”. Unfortunately, the series was cancelled shortly after its premiere, and Maguire pursued other acting opportunities.</p><p>Prior to his success with “Spider-Man”, he starred in such film productions as “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas”, “Ride with the Devil”, and voiced a character in Lawrence Guterman’s film “Cats & Dogs”.</p><p>Currently, Tobey Maguire is working as a co-producer of an upcoming sci-fi movie called “Z for Zachariah”, where the main characters are played by Margot Robie, Chris Pine and Chiwetel Ejiofor.</p><p>A famous actor and film producer, Tobey Maguire has an estimated net worth of $75 million.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Tobey Maguire</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$75 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>1.315&nbsp;million USD</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>June 27, 1975</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Santa Monica, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>5 ft 8 in (1.75 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>84&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Film Producer</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>General Educational Development, Florida State University, Auburn University, Jonesboro High School</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>United States of America</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Jennifer Meyer (m. 2007-2016)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Ruby Sweetheart Maguire, Otis Tobias Maguire</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Vincent Maguire, Wendy Brown, Harry Douglas III, Stephanie Douglas, Tobey Maguire, Jennifer Meyer</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Jopaul Epp, Weston Epp, Timothy Maguire, Vincent Maguire Jr.</td></tr><tr><td>Nicknames</td><td>Tobias Vincent Maguire , Tobias Maguire , Tobias Vincent “Tobey” Maguire</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td>https://twitter.com/tobeymaguire</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001497</td></tr><tr><td>Allmusic</td><td>www.allmusic.com/artist/tobey-maguire-mn0002576713</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Scream Award for Best Superhero (2007), Saturn Award for Best Actor (2004), MTV Movie Award for Best Kiss (2002), Teen Choice Awards, Toronto Film Critics Association Award (2000), Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor (1998)</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Nominated – Kids’ Choice Award for Favorite Movie Actors, Phoenix Film Critics Society Award (2000), Teen Choice Awards, MTV Movie Awards, Saturn Awards, Golden Globe Award for Best Actor (2009)</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>“Z for Zachariah” (2015), “The Cider House Rules” (1999), “Wonder Boys” (2000), “Seabiscuit” (2003), “The Good German” (2006), “Pleasantville” (1998), “Spider-Man 2” (2004), “Spider-Man” (2002), Spider-Man 3 (2007), “Brothers” (2009), “The Great Gatsby” (2013)</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>The Spoils of Babylon, Great Scott!, Wild & Crazy Kids</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Title</th><th>Salary</th></tr><tr><td>Spider-Man 3 (2007)</td><td>$15,000,000 plus 7.5% back-end</td></tr><tr><td>Spider-Man 2 (2004)</td><td>$17,500,000 plus 5% back-end</td></tr><tr><td>Seabiscuit (2003)</td><td>$12,500,000</td></tr><tr><td>Spider-Man (2002)</td><td>$4,000,000</td></tr></table><table class=quotes><tr><th>Quote</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>I’ve been mistaken for so many different actors, it’s just wild. I’ve gotten Jake Gyllenhaal a few times, like, ‘Loved you in Brokeback Mountain (2005)!’</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>I’m close to being a vegan, but I’m not one, technically. I don’t eat eggs, or nearly any dairy – no cheese or milk. I do eat honey, and a piece of milk chocolate here and there. It’s never really been that hard for me. I’ve never had any desire to eat meat. In fact, when I was a kid I would have a really difficult time eating meat at all. It had to be the perfect bite, with no fat or gristle or bone or anything like that. I don’t judge people who eat meat – that’s not for me to say – but the whole thing just sort of bums me out.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Every actor has to establish a presence that not only fits the overall needs of the story but allows him to interact with other actors in a credible and meaningful way. Every actor wants to work under conditions and with material that enables them to create and use their craft.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>I was pretty ambitious. I felt like I had a good imagination and vision for my life. And I had people telling me ‘You are driving the vehicle of your life here. You are the master of your own destiny in a sense. Do whatever you want to do.’</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>[on ending the Spider-Man film series with the third installment] “To me it seems like this is a natural point for the team to break up because we have a lot of story conclusions that were going along for the main characters for the first two movies and we kind of tie almost everything up for the third movie. It feels like a trilogy to me and it feels like the end.”</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>I think fame is a really complicated thing. It can be a great challenge to handle the difficult parts of it and strengthen your character so you don’t get affected in a negative way by it. And I’m scared and excited and hesitant and anxious. I’m conflicted about it, truly.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>All the people throughout my life who were naysayers pissed me off. But they’ve all given me a fervor; an angry ambition that cannot be stopped – and I look forward to finding a therapist and working on that.</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts><tr><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Two of his half brothers make a cameo appearance as boys wearing masks in the train scene in Spiderman 2.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Filming Spider-Man 3 (2007) in New York.
