His explosive and braggadocious personality, along with his notorious social commentaries on everything, helped him become one of the most famous internet personalities on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Along with his brother, Tristan, the two have claimed that they have "broken the matrix" of social media. They create headline after headline for their controversial antics on the most absurd things: their views on the lack of masculinity in sushi, their overzealous love of sparkling water, to their complete denial of the existence of depression.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Drake The Climate Criminal? Rapper Slammed For Taking 14-Minute Jet Trip</a></span></p><p>So, who are Andrew and Tristan Tate, and how did they seemingly come out of nowhere and conquer everyone's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"For You" page</a> on TikTok? Here are some interesting facts about the Tate brothers, and what they've said about those dangerous allegations.</p><h2 id=what-andrew-tate-did-before-tiktok><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>What Andrew Tate Did Before TikTok</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emory Andrew Tate III hailed from Chicago, Illinois. Born in December 1986, the now-35-year-old grew up under his father's guidance, who was an international chess master at the time. His dad, Emory Andrew Tate Jr., also had a brief stint as a staff sergeant in the United States Air Force thanks to his polyglot tongue.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2022, Andrew is a proud bearer of a four-time world champion kickboxing title, including the ISKA World Full-Contact Light Cruiserweight Champion. His first title came when he was just 23 years old, and he retired in September 2017.</p><h2 id=where-andrew-tate-lives><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Where Andrew Tate Lives</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Andrew Tate moved to Bucharest, Romania, where he currently lives with his brother Tristan, in 2017. The reason? It's quite chilling. In one of his YouTube videos, he said that "40 percent" of the reason was because the police force in the country is less likely to pursue sexual assault allegations. At the time, the British police charged him with 11 cases of sexual assault, and the story continues as the Romanian police raided his residence in April 2022 over a human trafficking and rape investigation.</p><h2 id=who-is-andrew-tate-39-s-brother-tristan><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Who Is Andrew Tate's Brother, Tristan?</span></h2><p>Andrew Tate's brother, Tristan, has followed in his sibling's footsteps. Born in the United Kingdom, the 33-year-old is a former mixed martial artist and has appeared in the Channel 4 reality series Shipwrecked: The Island, where he was crowned the leader of the pack with an explosive personality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tristan Tate also stepped onto the ring to fight but had reportedly retired due to a serious shoulder injury after a car accident. As he moved to Romania, he faced an illicit tryst scandal with the country's infamous TV host Bianca Dragusanu in 2021. Up to this writing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he's amassed almost 1 million followers on Instagram.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What's Usher And Justin Bieber's Relationship Like Today?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-to-andrew-tate-on-big-brother><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>What Happened To Andrew Tate On Big Brother?</span></h2><p>Andrew Tate's history has an ugly side when it comes to her treatment of women. In 2016, a year before his boxing retirement, he took a part in the 17th season of the British version of Big Brother before he got booted off after a video of him hitting a woman with a belt circulated online.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As BBC originally reported, the former kickboxer vehemently denied the claims, saying, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They are pretending I beat her up when we were joking </a>and the belt made noise but didn't hurt! They cut all laughing."</p><h2 id=did-andrew-tate-challenge-jake-paul-in-a-boxing-match><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Did Andrew Tate Challenge Jake Paul In A Boxing Match?</span></h2><p>In the summer of 2022, Andrew Tate challenged Jake Paul, a former Disney star who is known for his bizarre antics and a rising star in boxing, in a $3 million bet. Tate added more fuel to the fire during an episode of his Emergency Meeting podcast where he said he would obliterate the Problem Child in a combat. In his own words, "If me and Jake Paul fight, I would destroy him."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> Exclusive: Jaeden Gomez Discusses Her Rise to 1M+ TikTok Followers</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=andrew-tate-39-s-scamming-business><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Andrew Tate's Scamming Business</span></h2><p>After he moved to Romania, Andrew ran an X-rated webcam business where he used models to trick lonely men into sending them a good amount of money, starting from $4. As Mirror reported, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">brothers often bragged about how their business was "a total scam," </a>but the authorities couldn't stop them as they didn't have good legal backings.</p><p>He said that one man once gave up his £20,000 inheritance to one of his 75 lingerie-clad models, and some even went bankrupt. Additionally, they also claim to own a casino in Romania which he opened back in 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-andrew-tate-39-s-hustlers-university><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>What Is Andrew Tate's Hustlers University?</span></h2><p>Andrew and Tristan Tate eventually gave up the webcam business and opened their online course, Hustlers University, which boasts over 90,000 students all around the world. According to the website, the course teaches its "students" how to get rich through several entrepreneurial channels, like market affiliating and copywriting.</p><h2 id=how-did-andrew-tate-get-famous-on-tiktok-without-even-having-an-account><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>How Did Andrew Tate Get Famous On TikTok Without Even Having An Account?</span></h2><p>The Tate Brothers claim that they do not have a TikTok account, but how did they exactly become famous in a seemingly short time?
