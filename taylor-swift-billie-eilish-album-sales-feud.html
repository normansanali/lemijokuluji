After all, <a href=#>Eilish became rich</a> and famous for crafting unique and popular songs as she <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">lived with Tourette syndrome</a>. Unfortunately, according to some reports, Eilish may be feuding with one of her only peers, <strong><a href=#>Taylor Swift</a></strong>.</p><p>No matter <a href=#>how many songs Swift has written</a> and released already, it is a big deal when she releases a new album that <a href=#>will make her richer</a>. Unfortunately for Eilish, in 2024, she released her latest album weeks after Swift put out new music, and her rumored rival crushed her sales.</p><p>This article will reveal how much <strong>more Taylor Swift's 2024 album sold the week Billie Eilish released her 2024 album</strong>.

In fact, for many people, it quickly seemed like none of the other songs on the music charts mattered very much at that time.</p><p>However, it seemed like Swift's peers could rest assured that their music would be more relevant a month later. As a result, it made sense that some observers expected Billie Eilish's album to rule supreme when it was released weeks later.</p><p>Unfortunately for Eilish, The Daily Mail reported that things didn't exactly work out that way for her. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Swift's album which had been out for weeks outsold Eilish's album</strong></a> amid rumors that the two singers were feuding.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_are-taylor-swift-and-billie-eilish-friends-or-enemies-_bk_a1_v2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Taylor Swift's fans may remember, she released "The Tortured Poets Department" on April 19, 2024.

Citing Billboard, The Daily Mail reported that <strong>"The Tortured Poets Department" sold the equivalent of 378,000 albums</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Alternatively, <strong>Eilish's "Hit Me Hard and Soft" reportedly sold 339,000 equivalent album units</strong>.

Like most feud rumors, people learn about the gossip at various times, so it can be <strong>hard to know when the feud rumors began</strong>.</p><p>What is clear, however, is that many of Swift's fans thought that Eilish called Swift out for releasing several different versions of her albums. According to an article from The Things, that belief stemmed from <strong><a href=#>Eilish talking to Billboard about how bad that is for the environment</a></strong>. "I can’t even express to you how wasteful it is."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Eilish later clarified that she wasn't calling Swift out. Eilish also pointed out that while talking to Billboard, Eilish called herself out for selling various versions of the same album in the past.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fans-were-disappointed-in-billie-eilish-after-she-refused-to-sign-autographs-for-this-specific-reason-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Fans Were Disappointed In Billie Eilish After She Refused To Sign Autographs For This Specific Reason">Fans Were Disappointed In Billie Eilish After She Refused To Sign Autographs For This Specific Reason</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Billie Eilish's unique connection with her fans was questioned after she refused to sign autographs.</p><p>Looking at those comments in the full context and the fact that Eilish and Swift have praised each other, <strong>they likely weren't feuding in May 2024</strong>. Still, many fans believed that the duo didn't get along.</p><p>Many of Billie Eilish's fans also believe that she and Taylor Swift have been feuding. According to Yahoo! News, some of Eilish's fans accused Swift of intentionally sabotaging the release of "Hit Me Hard and Soft".</p><p>Believing in the supposed feud made some of <strong>Swift's fans delight in "The Tortured Poets Department" outselling "Hit Me Hard and Soft"</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/billie-eilish-3.jpg><p>However, The Daily Mail's article about Swift's album beating Eilish revealed that <strong>both singers had reasons to be happy</strong>. In Eilish's case, even though Swift's album did better, "Hit Me Hard and Soft" was a huge hit for the "Bad Guy" singer.</p><p>Eilish was already a music superstar before "Hit Me Hard and Soft" was released. With that in mind, it is amazing to note that the week that "Hit Me Hard and Soft" <strong>was the best-selling period of Eilish's career</strong>. According to The Daily Mail, Eilish had never sold 339,000 equivalent album units in a week before.</p><p>With Eilish selling more albums than ever before, losing to Swift shouldn't sting at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-rumors-about-taylor-swift-and-billie-eilish-feuding-caused-very-toxic-online-discourse>The Rumors About Taylor Swift And Billie Eilish Feuding Caused Very Toxic Online Discourse</h2><p>Around the same time that Taylor Swift's 2024 album outperformed Billie Eilish's, fans believed there was new evidence of them supposedly feuding. In May 2024, someone uploaded audio of <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eilish saying something that was perceived as a slight against Swift</a></strong>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/travis-kelce-continues-to-come-clean_gr-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Travis Kelce Continues To Come Clean About If He Actually Likes Taylor Swift's Music">Travis Kelce Continues To Come Clean About If He Actually Likes Taylor Swift's Music</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift's fans want to know if Travis Kelce really likes his girlfriend's music.</p><p>At the time, a Swift fan account uploaded audio of Eilish saying that three-hour concerts are ridiculous as an article from The Cut reveals.</p><p>“Nobody wants that. You guys don’t want that … I don’t even want that as a fan. My favorite artist in the world — I’m not trying to hear them for three hours. You know what I mean? Far too long.”</p><p>Since Swift is known for performing for that long, Swift's fans believed Eilish was calling her out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52673993.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Is it possible that Eilish made that comment to call out Swift? Yes, it is. Should fans assume that Eilish was calling Swift out? Certainly not. After all, Eilish previously told people to stop assuming she has an issue with Swift.</p><p>On top of that, Eilish never mentioned Swift in her comments and the audio was uploaded completely out of context. In fact, even the question Eilish was asked that prompted her comment about three-hour concerts was edited out of the clip that went viral on X.</p><p>Despite all the reasons to believe that Eilish wasn't calling Swift out, she was the subject of another backlash.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lkp65rbXEZpyipJmotW6ty5uspmWjlrmmv4yfnK6cXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-billie-eilish-album-sales-feud.html&text=Taylor%20Swift%20Gets%20Revenge%20On%20Billie%20Eilish%20Amid%20Their%20Rumored%20Feud%20By%20Squashing%20Her%20Album%20Sales&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-billie-eilish-album-sales-feud.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-billie-eilish-album-sales-feud.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Gets%20Revenge%20On%20Billie%20Eilish%20Amid%20Their%20Rumored%20Feud%20By%20Squashing%20Her%20Album%20Sales" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-swift-billie-eilish-album-sales-feud.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Gets%20Revenge%20On%20Billie%20Eilish%20Amid%20Their%20Rumored%20Feud%20By%20Squashing%20Her%20Album%20Sales" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-billie-eilish-album-sales-feud.html&title=Taylor%20Swift%20Gets%20Revenge%20On%20Billie%20Eilish%20Amid%20Their%20Rumored%20Feud%20By%20Squashing%20Her%20Album%20Sales" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-billie-eilish-album-sales-feud.html&description=Taylor%20Swift%20Gets%20Revenge%20On%20Billie%20Eilish%20Amid%20Their%20Rumored%20Feud%20By%20Squashing%20Her%20Album%20Sales" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-dave-portnoys-net-worth-in-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Dave Portnoy's Net Worth in 2024?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./719163-sza-argues-with-fan-in-ig-dms-social-media-takes-singers-side.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="SZA Argues With Fan In IG DMs, Social Media Takes Singer's Side">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
