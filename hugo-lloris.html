He played in that position continuously for two years. Then, for some time, he switched between striker and goalkeeper before settling on for keeper’s role for good&nbsp;after joining Nice’s academy.</li><li>While growing up, he excelled in tennis and was considered as one of the finest talents in the youth circuit. However, at the age of 13, he decided to give up tennis and focus solely on soccer.</li><li>He started playing soccer at the age of 6 at&nbsp;CEDAC (Centre de Diffusion et d’Action Culturelle), which is a cultural center based in Nice that offers a range of activities including soccer.</li><li>In August 2010, it was revealed that he would be featured alongside <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Karim Benzema</a> on the cover of the FIFA 11’s French version.</li><li>Hugo was recommended to Nice by&nbsp;Dominique Baratelli, the former French international and ONG Nice goalkeeper. He was signed by the Nice’s academy at the age of 10.</li><li>In his debut season in 2005-06, he delivered great performances to help his side reach their first-ever&nbsp;Coupe de la Ligue final with tremendous performances in quarter-finals and semi-finals.</li><li>In the summer of 2008, he was heavily courted by the European heavyweights such as AC Milan and Tottenham Hotspur. However, he decided to join Lyon as he felt he would get opportunities to play more regularly with the French club.</li><li>Milan vice-president, Adriano Galliani, later revealed that they practically sealed Lloris’s move to AC Milan, which was only scuppered by Christian Abbiati’s refusal to move to Palermo.</li><li>In his debut season with Lyon, Hugo finished with 16 clean sheets, which was the 2nd best in the league. He was selected as the best goalkeeper in the league and included in Team of the Year as well.</li><li>In December 2009, he finished in the 3rd position behind&nbsp;Nicolas Anelka&nbsp;and&nbsp;Yoann Gourcuff in a voting conducted by France Football for the&nbsp;French Player of the Year&nbsp;award.</li><li>At the end of 2009-10 season, he was recognized as&nbsp;UNFP Ligue 1 Goalkeeper of the Year. This was his 2nd consecutive win.</li><li>In 2010, he was nominated for the&nbsp;UEFA Club Goalkeeper of the Year. However, he lost out to&nbsp;Júlio César, who had played a key role in Internazionale’s UEFA Champions League title.</li><li>In August 2012, he was purchased from Lyon by Tottenham Hotspur in a deal worth&nbsp;€10&nbsp;million with further €5&nbsp;million tied up in add-ons. Spurs also agreed to give Lyon&nbsp;20% of Lloris’s future transfer profit.</li><li>His Premier League debut for Spurs ended American keeper&nbsp;Brad Friedel’s incredible run of 310 consecutive games in the Premier League.</li><li>In November 2013, he lost consciousness after colliding with <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Romelu Lukaku</a>‘s knee in a match against Everton. However, he still completed the match. This led to&nbsp;FIFA and FIFPro, the head injury charities, severely criticizing Spurs manager&nbsp;André Villas-Boas for continuing with Lloris even after his collision.</li><li>In August 2015,&nbsp;Tottenham manager&nbsp;<a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Mauricio Pochettino</a>&nbsp;made Lloris the permanent&nbsp;captain&nbsp;of the team.</li><li>In December 2016, Lloris signed a 6 years contract extension with the London based club to extend his stay at the club until 2022. This helped club in avoiding Manchester United’s interest in the following summer transfer season as they sought to replace <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>David de Gea</a>, who was on a verge of the transfer to Real Madrid.</li><li>In June 2018, he made his 100th appearance for France in a FIFA World Cup group stage match against Peru. His side managed to keep the clean sheet in the 1-0 victory.</li><p>Featured Image by&nbsp;Станислав Ведмидь / Football.us / CC BY-SA 3.0</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqGsoKddobmwvsisZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhugo-lloris.html&text=Hugo%20Lloris%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhugo-lloris.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhugo-lloris.html&title=Hugo%20Lloris%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhugo-lloris.html&title=Hugo%20Lloris%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhugo-lloris.html&title=Hugo%20Lloris%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhugo-lloris.html&description=Hugo%20Lloris%20Height%2c%20Weight%2c%20Age%2c%20Spouse%2c%20Family%2c%20Facts%2c%20Biography" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./japanese-snow-monsters.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Juhyou, The Japanese Snow Monsters Nearing Extinction">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./how-to-take-protein-powder.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How to take protein powder">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
