We've rounded up <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 shows like Emily in Paris,</a> including where you can stream them.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Younger'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Like Emily in Paris, this TV Land series also comes from Darren Star — and the similarities don't stop there. When 40-something Liza Miller (Sutton Foster) finds herself divorced and without any money, she decides to pretend that she's in her twenties to get a job in publishing. Much of the plot takes place in her New York City workplace, which gives it a similar vibe to Emily in Paris.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Liza has an uphill battle when it comes to finding a place at her company.&nbsp;</p><p>Like the Netflix series, there is a persistent love triangle on Younger. Instead of the Gabriel-Camille-Emily mess, there's the Liza-Josh-Charles scenario. Liza's love interests are played by Nico Tortorella and Peter Hermann. Disney icon Hilary Duff and Entourage star Debi Mazar also star in the show.</p><p>You can stream the first six seasons of Younger on Hulu, YouTube TV, or on TV Land.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Love Life'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO Max</span></figure><p>The first season of the HBO Max anthology series debuted in May of 2020, and Season 2 premiered in 2021.</p><p>Season 1 of Love Life focuses on Darby (Anna Kendrick), and the meaningful relationships she has before she meets "the one." Like Emily, Darby doesn't want to settle, and there are a few suitors who viewers will root for.</p><p>Just like how Gabriel isn't exactly the definition of a good boyfriend in Season 1 of Emily in Paris, Darby's various boyfriends all have their own flaws — which makes the end reveal all the more surprising. However, after two seasons, Love Life was canceled by HBO Max.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Gossip Girl'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Gossip Girl is the only show on this list that is explicitly mentioned on Emily in Paris. In the sixth episode, "Ringarde," Emily bonds with Pierre Caddault over the teen drama (we'll all look past the fact that Emily picked Serena van der Woodsen as a style icon when she clearly dresses like Blair Waldorf).</p><p>The fashion choices and the cityscapes alone will attract fans of Emily in Paris to Gossip Girl. Plus, the frenemy relationship between Blair and Serena feels somewhat similar to Emily's difficult work relationship with Sylvie.&nbsp;</p><p>Gossip Girl is now on Netflix.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Sweetbitter'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>If you finished Emily in Paris and you are hoping to binge-watch another series that has a slow burn, check out Sweetbitter.</p><p>The plot focuses on Tess (Ella Purnell) who moves to the Big Apple to work in a trendy restaurant. While learning about her new city and getting caught up to speed on her new job, Tess has a sizzling romance with bartender Jake (Tom Sturridge).</p><p>Fans are still bitter (pun intended) that the Starz series was canceled after Season 2.&nbsp;</p><p>Both seasons of Sweetbitter are available to stream on Starz now.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'The Bold Type'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Freeform</span></figure><p>Many viewers are comparing Emily in Paris to The Bold Type because it balances the workplace with the characters’ personal lives. Like Emily, the three protagonists are millennials who are trying to thrive at work. Jane Sloan (Katie Stevens), Kat Edison (Aisha Dee), and Sutton Brady (Meghann Fahy) are employees at a fictional magazine called Scarlett (think Cosmo). The women navigate their own friendships and workplace romances while making names for themselves in the cutthroat media industry.</p><p>The Bold Type can be streamed on Hulu.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Jane by Design'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Though Jane By Design only aired on Freeform for one season (back when the network was still known as ABC Family), it developed a cult following of loyal viewers during its run. After teenager Jane Quimby (Erica Dasher) is mistaken for an adult, she receives a full-time job offer at a fashion company.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite her age and still being in high school full-time, Jane thrives at her job.</p><p>Her quick (and somewhat unrealistic) adjustment to the work is similar to how Emily becomes Savoir's top employee without speaking French.&nbsp;</p><p>The dynamic between Jane and her boss, Gray (who is played by Andie MacDowell) resembles the complicated nature of Sylvie and Emily's relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>The one and only season of Jane By Design can be streamed on Hulu.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Sex and the City'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: HBO</span></figure><p>The six-season HBO series is Darren Star's most notable creation, and it is still beloved and widely viewed by fans more than 18 years since it went off the air. The raunchy comedy highlights four best friends who are in their thirties and forties as they navigate work, love, and empowering one another.</p><p>Like Emily Cooper, there's no explaining how Carrie Bradshaw (Sarah Jessica Parker) can afford her couture fashion looks in the series, and that's not the only commonality between the two shows.</p><p>Some are even calling Emily in Paris' Mindy Chen (Ashley Park) the Samantha of the show for her ability to turn anything into a sex joke.</p><p>Plus, Gabriel also has the potential to be a Mr. Big-esque character, since he's already polarizing viewers based on some of his less-than-noble behavior.</p><p>Sex and the City is available on both Hulu and HBO Max.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'The Carrie Diaries'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>The criminally underrated CW series got axed after two seasons, and it showcases Carrie Bradshaw's picturesque Connecticut origin story in the '80s. This time, the future columnist is played by AnnaSophia Robb, and Mr. Big is nowhere to be found.</p><p>Though Carrie is a teenager at the beginning of the series, she's similar to Emily because she's looking to leave her comfort zone and to challenge herself in an unfamiliar city.&nbsp;</p><p>Viewers can watch The Carrie Diaries on CW Seed.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Hart of Dixie'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: The CW</span></figure><p>The Rachel Bilson-led drama shares a low-stakes plot, a compelling love triangle, and a protagonist trying to assimilate to a new place with Emily in Paris.</p><p>Zoe (Rachel) moves to Alabama to become a general practitioner, and she later finds out that her late biological father left her a practice. Her neighbors don't initially accept her, and she struggles with whether or not she should make her new town a permanent home.</p><p>Hart of Dixie is available on Netflix.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">'Girlboss'</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Britt Robertson starred in the only season of the Netflix original. The 13-episode series was loosely adapted from the autobiography of the same name from Nasty Gal founder Sophia Amoruso.&nbsp;</p><p>When she gets fired from her job at a shoe store, Sophia Marlowe decides to use what's left of her savings to create a vintage clothing brand online.&nbsp;</p><p>Sophia's innovation and work spirit will remind viewers of Emily Cooper, and her somewhat ill-fated romance with Shane (Johnny Simmons) mirrors the story between Gabriel and Emily.</p><p>Girlboss and Emily in Paris are available to stream on Netflix now.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLWww9Jmo6KjlWKyrrXLsmSipl2lrrO10g%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fshows-like-emily-in-paris.html&text=Say%20Bonjour%20to%20These%2010%20Shows%20Like%20%27Emily%20in%20Paris%27%20%20What%20to%20Stream%20Right%20Now%21&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshows-like-emily-in-paris.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshows-like-emily-in-paris.html&title=Say%20Bonjour%20to%20These%2010%20Shows%20Like%20%27Emily%20in%20Paris%27%20%20What%20to%20Stream%20Right%20Now%21" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fshows-like-emily-in-paris.html&title=Say%20Bonjour%20to%20These%2010%20Shows%20Like%20%27Emily%20in%20Paris%27%20%20What%20to%20Stream%20Right%20Now%21" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fshows-like-emily-in-paris.html&title=Say%20Bonjour%20to%20These%2010%20Shows%20Like%20%27Emily%20in%20Paris%27%20%20What%20to%20Stream%20Right%20Now%21" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshows-like-emily-in-paris.html&description=Say%20Bonjour%20to%20These%2010%20Shows%20Like%20%27Emily%20in%20Paris%27%20%20What%20to%20Stream%20Right%20Now%21" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sean-payton.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sean Payton Bio, Age, Net Worth, Married, Facts, Career, Wiki">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./pollyanna-mcintosh-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pollyanna McIntosh Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
