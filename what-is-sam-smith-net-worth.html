From Stay With Me to the number one Billboard 100 single, Unholy, fans melt at the sound of the voice that has <a href=#>won multiple awards over several categories</a>. And while the issues on the albums Smith has released to date may not specifically be singing about themes that all of their fans have encountered, there is a reliability to their songs that appeals to a wide audience. A fact that has helped the Lay Me Down singer amass a great deal of fortune in just a decade.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That fortune and the fame that has come with being a celebrity has caused Smith some heartache. This is because <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fame has been something of a double-edged sword for them</a>. "Fame is probably the biggest issue I have in my life," Smith explained. "Relationships change and family can change."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sam Smith Explains What A 'Proper Knees Up' Is On Episode Of 'Hot Ones' With Sean Evans</a></span></p><p>However, in noting how being in the spotlight is difficult, the I'm Not the Only One singer recognized that they are "very lucky to be in [their] position." Life just becomes more challenging and "gets turned on its head" when artists go from being another face in the crowd to becoming incredibly famous. While Smith may be famous, it has been three years since a studio album has been released and the money from those previous albums was collected. Does this mean that a decade after their "breakthrough" Sam Smith's net worth has peaked? Not if the singer has anything to say about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-sam-smith-39-s-net-worth>What Is Sam Smith's Net Worth?</h2><p>Smith has gone from relative obscurity to superstar in one decade. A feat that is difficult to accomplish in the entertainment industry. What is even more amazing is that year after year, the Like I Can singer's fortune continues to rise, regardless of whether new music is released or not.</p><p>Because of this, Smith's wealth is only expected to continue to grow.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar50269981.jpg><p>The current estimates for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith's net worth have them at $45 million</a>. The climb to this lofty amount has been not only consistent but impressive.</p><p>This is because estimates show that there was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">no fortune of note in 2012</a>. Yet by 2013, Smith had amassed over $1.5 million, jumping to $8.7 million in 2014, and over $20 million in both 2015 and 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sam Smith Accepts Shawn Mendes' Apology After Using Incorrect Pronoun During Jingle Ball Introduction</a></span></p><p>Year after year, the Fire on Fire singer's net worth has increased. And with only three studio albums released, this seems like quite a sum to have amassed.</p><p>But it is not album sales alone that have gotten Smith's bank account as healthy as it has become.</p><h2 id=how-sam-smith-made-their-money>How Sam Smith Made Their Money</h2><p><a href=#>The non-binary singer</a> has several ways that income is collected. And while album sales do factor into the total impressive net worth, they are by far not the way the bulk of Smith's money is earned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar50435197.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The majority of the money that Smith earns is from selling out concerts. Doing this has made up nearly half of the $45 million, with "$20,400,000" alone coming from ticket sales.</p><p>Album and single sales make up a nice chunk of change as well, with nearly $12,500,000 being earned since Smith released his debut album.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Sam Smith Covers Cyndi Lauper's 'Time After Time' For New Live Album And Fans Are In Love</a></span></p><p>Smith is also one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"highest-earning music artists" when it comes to earning royalties</a>. This is because, between Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, Amazon, and other companies, Smith brings in over $7 million.</p><h2 id=sam-smith-39-s-net-worth-may-not-have-peaked-just-yet>Sam Smith's Net Worth May Not Have Peaked Just Yet</h2><p>While Smith has not put out a new studio album in several years, that is about to change. That is because, at the end of January, Gloria is being released. And <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">based on the collaborations on the album</a>, it appears that Smith will have yet another hit on their hands.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From Ed Sheeran to Jessie Reyez, Koffee, and Kim Petras, there is a lot of talent on Gloria. Couple that with Smith's smooth vocals and the combination, at least on paper, appears to be the makings of an album fans will flock to.</p><p>In addition to the album being released, it has also been announced that Smith will be touring to promote Gloria. Fans in the US will be delighted to learn that the tour kicks off in July in Miami, FL. The reason this is big news is that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith has not toured the US since 2018</a>.</p><p>This means that not only will they be playing a set list with new material from Gloria but many fans will see tracks from Love Goes performed live for the first time as well. Sprinkle in hits from the first two albums and the show should be something all Smith fans will enjoy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Further dates for Gloria The Tour will be taking Smith through New Zealand, Australia, the UK, Netherlands, Finland, Germany, France, and more. Needless to say, Smith will be busy during 2023.</p><p>What this touring means for Smith's net worth is that it is going to climb exponentially.</p><p>Not only will they bring in money from album sales when released but with ticket sales going on sale before the drop of Gloria, it is a matter of months, not years before Smith's net worth climbs even higher than the impressive number it stands at today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0edKapGarnZ7BqXnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-sam-smith-net-worth.html&text=A%20Decade%20After%20Their%20%26quot%3bBreakthrough%2c%26quot%3b%20Has%20Sam%20Smith%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Peaked%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-sam-smith-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-sam-smith-net-worth.html&title=A%20Decade%20After%20Their%20%26quot%3bBreakthrough%2c%26quot%3b%20Has%20Sam%20Smith%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Peaked%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-is-sam-smith-net-worth.html&title=A%20Decade%20After%20Their%20%26quot%3bBreakthrough%2c%26quot%3b%20Has%20Sam%20Smith%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Peaked%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-sam-smith-net-worth.html&title=A%20Decade%20After%20Their%20%26quot%3bBreakthrough%2c%26quot%3b%20Has%20Sam%20Smith%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Peaked%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-sam-smith-net-worth.html&description=A%20Decade%20After%20Their%20%26quot%3bBreakthrough%2c%26quot%3b%20Has%20Sam%20Smith%27s%20Net%20Worth%20Peaked%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./charlotte-arnould.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Charlotte Arnould">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./barbershop-3-things-to-know-nicki-minaj.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="18 Things to Know about the Sequel">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
