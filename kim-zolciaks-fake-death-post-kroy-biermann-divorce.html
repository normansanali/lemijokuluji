Although her secretive relationship with "Big Poppa" was her most dramatic storyline on the Bravo reality series, her marriage to Kroy Biermann is what gets people talking these days. But while the couple once appeared to be totally in love, they have been in the process of getting divorced since spring 2023.</p><p>The <a href=#>couple has been dealing with terrible money issues</a> for years now and <a href=#>Andy Cohen even said Zolciak spent too much money</a>. The story of the couple's divorce keeps getting stranger. For example, in the summer of 2023, there was a false <a href=#>rumor that Zolciak kidnapped her and Biermann's son</a>.

Zolciak's social media post that suggested that Biermann died was shocking, upsetting, and strange.</p><p>The Daily Mail reported that <strong>Zolciak shared a black and white photo of Biermann with "R.I.P." and a broken heart emoji</strong> on her Instagram account in April 2024. She also wrote "link in bio" and shared a giveaway that would allow her Instagram followers to get Chanel products or cash.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/what-ae-the-financial-issues-with-kim-zolciak-and-kroy-biermann-and-how-did-they-get-themselves-into-so-much-trouble_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since <strong>Biermann is still alive</strong>, this was an alarming and disturbing photo to see.
