Since then, he has had a significant impact on the growth and success of the league. Silver is responsible for overseeing the NBA, WNBA, NBA G League, NBA 2K League, and Basketball Africa League. He has played a key role in the development of these leagues and has been recognized for his contributions to the sports business industry.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Before becoming commissioner, Silver worked as the NBA Deputy Commissioner and Chief Operating Officer. During this time, he helped the league become the first to launch its own cable network in 1999. He also oversaw the incorporation of team websites in 1995, which helped to increase the league's exposure and popularity.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>One of Silver's biggest challenges as commissioner came in 2020, as the NBA faced multiple challenges. The first challenge was a controversy over a tweet supporting Hong Kong protesters. This led to a backlash in China, where the NBA has a significant following. Silver had to navigate these tensions carefully to ensure that the league's relationships with its partners in China remained intact.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>The second challenge was the suspension of the season due to the coronavirus pandemic. Silver had to make the difficult decision to cancel the season, which had significant financial implications for the league. He also had to negotiate with players to create the NBA bubble, which was a success in preventing the spread of the virus.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Despite these challenges, Silver remains optimistic about the future of the league. He has been a vocal advocate for social justice and has spoken out about racial inequality. Silver has also been involved in various organizations and serves on multiple boards, including the National Basketball Players Association Foundation and the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Board of Trustees.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Under Silver's leadership, the NBA has continued to grow and expand. In 2018, the league launched the Basketball Africa League, which is a partnership between the NBA and FIBA. The league is designed to promote basketball and economic growth in Africa. Silver has also been instrumental in the development of the NBA G League, which is the NBA's official minor league.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Another significant achievement under Silver's leadership is the growth of the WNBA. The league has seen an increase in viewership and sponsorship under Silver's guidance. He has also been a vocal advocate for gender equality in sports and has helped to create initiatives to support women's basketball.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>In addition to his work with the NBA, Silver has been involved in various philanthropic efforts. He has supported organizations such as the Thurgood Marshall College Fund and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Silver has also been recognized for his contributions to the sports business industry. In 2019, he was named one of Time's 100 Most Influential People in the World.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Adam Silver has had a significant impact on the NBA since becoming commissioner in 2014.
