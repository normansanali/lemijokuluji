Previously, he stated that he had gotten into acting without any intention of pursuing it.</p><p>“I didn’t really decide to become an actor; it was more me deciding to embrace the fact that I am an actor. Like when I was a kid I used to play a lot, just like every kid, but I took playing make believe seriously and basically what I do right now is just an evolution of that.”&nbsp;</p><p>- Cle Bennett on his acting career</p><p><i><strong>&nbsp;For more interesting topics, do visit the site </strong></i><a href=# rel=nofollow><i><strong>Married Celeb</strong></i></a><i><strong>.</strong></i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jpyjnmWSmruvsdOt</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcle-bennett.html&text=His%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Relationship%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Facts&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcle-bennett.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcle-bennett.html&title=His%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Relationship%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcle-bennett.html&title=His%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Relationship%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcle-bennett.html&title=His%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Relationship%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcle-bennett.html&description=His%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Relationship%2c%20%26amp%3b%20Facts" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kendall-jenner-makeup-artist-barely-there-no-makeup-natural-beauty.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kendall Jenners Makeup Artist's Tricks to Barely-There Beauty">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./run-rabbit-run-ending-explained.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Decoding the Ending of Netflix's Horror Thriller 'Run Rabbit Run'  What Happened?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
